The vision of our founding fathers and the aim and objectives which they\nwanted to achieve through the Constitution are contained in the Preamble, the Fundamental Rights and\nthe Directive Principles. These three may be described as the soul of the Constitution and the testa ment\nof founding fathers to the succeeding generations together with the later Part on Fundamental Duties .\nThe vision of socio-economic change through the Constitution is reflected in its Preamble. The Pream ble\nexpresses the ideals and aspirations of a renascent India. At independence, emerging out of a long p eriod\nof foreign domination and oppression under a feudal system, the people were grimly struggling to be\nreborn into a life of dignity and hope.\nThe scheme of the Constitution for realisation of socio-economic agenda comprises of both the justic iable\nFundamental Rights as well as the non-justiciable Directive Principles. The judicial contribution to  the\nsynthesis and the integration of Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles in the process of\n\"constitutionalising\" social and economic rights has been crucial to the realisation of the Directiv e Principles\nnot only as a means to effectuate Fundamental Rights but also as a source of laws for a welfare stat e.\n(Source: Report of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, 31st March, 20 02)\nThe Constitution places a pre-eminent emphasis on the values of liberty and justice, on treating all  citizens\nas equal before law and on safeguarding the rights of minorities and the oppressed. The people of In dia\nderive their existence as a political community from the Constitution, which \u201cwe the people\u201d, gave t o\nourselves and, in the process established the Republic of India. It is because the country is Republ ic, and\nnot a mere democracy, that the people are enjoined to nurture and indeed celebrate, their linguistic ,\nethnic, cultural and religious diversity and to ensure that the citizens do not suffer from want and  indignity.\nThough the Indian tapestry of traditional multiculturism nourished by many centuries of assimilative\nforces has been subjected to occasional fissures, the most diverse nation on earth has been able to\novercome those crises and use the innate strength of Indian Republic to uphold the dignity and integ rity\nof India.\nBroad Framework of the Constitution\nThe Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950. It is a comprehensive document. Apart\nfrom dealing with the structure of Government, the Constitution makes detailed provisions for the ri ghts\nof citizens and other persons in a number of entrenched provisions and for the principles to be foll owed\nby the State in the governance of the country, labelled as \u201cDirective Principles of State Policy\u201d.  All public\nauthorities \u2013 legislative, administrative and judicial derive their powers directly or indirectly fr om the\nConstitution which in turn derive its authority from the people.\nThe preamble to the Constitution sets out the aims and aspirations of the people of India. It is a p art of the\nConstitution. The preamble declares India to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic  and\nsecures to all its citizens Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. It is declared that the Const itution has\nbeen given by the people to themselves, thereby affirming the republican character of the polity and  the\nsovereignty of the people.\nThe polity assured to the people of India by the Constitution is described in the preamble as a Sove reign,\nSocialist, Secular, and Democratic Republic. The expression \u201cSovereign\u201d signifies that the Republic is\nexternally and internally sovereign. Sovereignty in the strict and narrowest sense of the term impli es\nindependence all round, within and without the borders of the country.  As discussed above, legal\nsovereignty is vested in the people of India and political sovereignty is distributed between the Un ion and\nthe States.\nThe democratic character of the Indian polity is illustrated by the provisions conferring on the adu lt\n192 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\ncitizens the right to vote and by the provisions for elected representatives and responsibility of t he executive\nto the legislature.\nThe word \u201cSocialist\u201d, added by the 42nd Amendment, aims to secure to its people \u201cjustice\u2014social,\neconomic and political\u201d. The Directive Principles of State Policy, contained in Part IV of the Const itution\nare designed for the achievement of the socialistic goal envisaged in the preamble. The expression\n\u201cDemocratic Republic\u201d signifies that our government is of the people, by the people and for the peop le.\nFederal or Unitary\nConstitution of India is basically federal but with certain unitary features. The majority of the Su preme\nCourt judges in  Kesavananda Bharati  v . State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461 , were of the view that the federal\nfeatures form the basic structure of  Indian Constitution. However, there are discussions as to whet her the\nIndian Constitution establishes a federal system or it stipulates a unitary form of Government with some\nbasic federal features. Thus, to decide whether Constitution is federal, unitary or quasi federal, i t would be\nbetter to have a look at the contents of the Constitution.\nThe essential features of a Federal Polity or System are\u2014dual Government, Distribution of Powers,\nSupremacy of the Constitution, Independence of Judiciary, Written Constitution, and a rigid procedur e\nfor the amendment of the Constitution.\nThe political system introduced by our Constitution possesses all the aforesaid essentials of a fede ral polity\nas both the Union and the State Governments and their respective organs derive their authority from the\nConstitution and it is not competent for the States to secede from the Union. There is a division of\nlegislative and executive powers between the Union and the State Governments. The Supreme Court\nstands at the head of our judiciary to guard against the violation of the constitutional provisions.  The\nSupreme Court decides disputes between the Union and the States, or the States inter se and interpre ts\nfinally the provisions of the Constitution.\nThe question as to whether the Indian Constitution has a federal form of Government or a unitary\nconstitution with some federal features came up in various cases before the Supreme Court and the Hi gh\nCourts. But in most cases, the observations have been made in a particular context and have to be\nunderstood accordingly. The question rests mostly on value judgement i.e. on one\u2019s own philosophy.\nFUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS\nThe Constitution seeks to secure to the people \u201cliberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and wo rship;\nequality of status and of opportunity; and fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual\u201d. With this object,\nthe fundamental rights are envisaged in Part III of the Constitution.\nPart III of the Indian Constitution guarantees six categories of fundamental rights. These are:\n\u2014Right to Equality \u2014 Articles 14 to 18;\n\u2014Right to Freedom \u2014 Articles 19 to 22;\n\u2014Right against Exploitation \u2014 Articles 23 and 24;\n\u2014Right to Freedom of Religion \u2014 Articles 25 to 28;\n\u2014Cultural and Educational Rights \u2014 Articles 29 and 30;\n\u2014Right to Constitutional Remedies \u2014 Articles 32.\nPreviously the right to property under Article 31 was also guaranteed as a Fundamental Right which h as\nbeen removed by the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978. Now right to property is not a fundamen tal\nright, it is now only a legal right.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 193\nApart from this, Articles 12 and 13 deal with definition of \u2018State\u2019 and \u2018Law\u2019 respectively. Articles  33 to 35\ndeal with the general provisions relating to Fundamental Rights.\nNo fundamental right in India is absolute and reasonable restrictions can be imposed in the interest  of the\nstate by valid legislation and in such case the Court normally would respect the legislative policy behind\nthe same.( People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India, (2004) 2 SCC 476).\nFrom the point of view of persons to whom the rights are available, the fundamental rights may be cl assified\nas follows:\n(a)Articles 15, 16, 19 and 30 are guaranteed only to citizens.\n(b)Articles 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 28 are available to any person on the soil of India\u2014citizen or\nforeigner.\n(c)The rights guaranteed by Articles 15, 17, 18, 20, 24 are absolute limitations upon the legislative\npower.\nState\nWith a few exceptions, all the fundamental rights are available against the State. Under Article 12,  unless\nthe context otherwise requires, \u201cthe State\u201d includes\u2014FUNDAMENTAL\nRIGHTSRight\nto\nEquality\nRight\nto\nFreedom\nRight\nagainst\nExploitation\nRight\nto Freedom of\nReligionCultural\nand\nEducational\nRightsRight\nto\nConstitutional\nRemedies\n194 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\n(a)the Government and Parliament of India;\n(b)the Government and the Legislature of each of the States; and\n(c)all local or other authorities:\n(i)within the territory of India; or\n(ii)under the control of the Government of India.\nThe expression \u2018local authorities\u2019 refers to authorities like Municipalities, District Boards, Panch ayats,\nImprovement Trusts, Port Trusts and Mining Settlement Boards. In Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib , AIR 1981 SC\n481, the Supreme Court has enunciated the following test for determining whether an entity is an\ninstrumentality or agency of the State:\n(1)If the entire share capital of the Corporation is held by the Government, it would go a long way\ntowards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government.\n(2)Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet almost the entire expenditure of\nthe corporation it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with\ngovernment character.\n(3)Whether the corporation enjoys a monopoly status which is conferred or protected by the State.\n(4)Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the corporation is a\nState agency or an instrumentality.\n(5)If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely related to government\nfunctions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying a corporation as an instrumentality or agenc y\nof government.\n(6)If a department of government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportin g\nan inference of the corporation being an instrumentality or agency of government.\nExample : An act is passed by the parliament. The subject matter of the Act was to grant certain pay\nrelated benefits to all employees of the State. Are only states of India(eg. State of Maharashtra or  Uttar\nPradesh) are required to comply with law?\nAccording to Article 12 of the constitution the word state includes not only States of India but als o\ncertain other authorities/ Organisations.\nJustifiability of Fundamental Rights\nArticle 13 gives teeth to the fundamental rights. It lays down the rules of interpretation in regard  to laws\ninconsistent with or in derogation of the Fundamental Rights.\nExisting Laws  : Article 13(1) relates to the laws already existing in force, i.e. laws which were in force before\nthe commencement of the Constitution. A declaration by the Court of their invalidity, however, will be\nnecessary before they can be disregarded and declares that pre-constitution laws are void to the ext ent\nto which they are inconsistent with the fundamental rights.\nFuture Laws  : Article 13(2) relates to future laws, i.e., laws made after the commencement of the Constitution.\nAfter the Constitution comes into force the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridge s the\nrights conferred by Part III and if such a law is made, it shall be void to the extent to which it c urtails any\nsuch right.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 195\nThe word \u2018law\u2019 according to the definition given in Article 13 itself  includes\u2014\n\u201c... any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having\nin the territory of India, the force of law.\u201d\nBy the Constitution (Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1971 a new clause has been added to Article 13\nwhich provides that\u2014\n\u201cNothing in this Article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article\n368\u201d\nArticle 13 came up for judicial review in a number of cases and the Courts have evolved doctrines li ke\ndoctrine of eclipse, severability, prospective overruling, acquiescence etc. for interpreting the pr ovisions\nof Article 13.\nExample: There was a Law in force before 26th January, 1950 which was against the Fundamental\nRights. It was contended that it can still be in force as the constitution does not make it void. Is  the\ncontention correct?\nAccording to Article 13(1) of the Constitution of India, all the laws that are inconsistent with Fun damental\nRights are void.\nRight of Equality\nRIGHT\nTO\nEQUALITYEquality\nbefore\nLaw\nProhibition of\nDiscrimination\non Grounds of\nReligion, Race,\nCaste, Sex or\nPlace of Birth\nEquality\nof\nOpportunity in\nMatters of Public\nEmploymentAbolition\nof\nUntouchabilityAbolition\nof\nTitles\n196 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\nArticles 14 to 18 of the Constitution deal with equality and its various facets. The general princip le finds\nexpression in Article 14. Particular applications of this right are dealt with in Articles 15 and 16 . Still more\nspecialised applications of equality are found in Articles 17 and 18.\nEquality before the law and equal protection of the laws\nArticle 14 of the Constitution says that \u201cthe State shall not deny to any person equality before the  law or\nthe equal protection of the laws within the territory of India\u201d.\nAs is evident, Article 14 guarantees to every person the right to equality before the law or the equ al\nprotection of the laws. The expression \u2018equality before the law\u2019 which is barrowed from English Comm on\nLaw is a declaration of equality of all persons within the territory of India, implying thereby the absence of\nany special privilege in favour of any individual. Every person, whatever be his rank or position is  subject\nto the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.\nThe second expression \u201cthe equal protection of the laws\u201d which is based on the last clause of the fi rst\nsection of the Fourteenth Amendment to the American Constitution directs that equal protection shall\nbe secured to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction of the Union in the enjoyment of their  rights and\nprivileges without favouritism or discrimination.\nArticle 14 applies to all persons and is not limited to citizens. A corporation, which is a juristic  person, is also\nentitled to the benefit of this Article ( Chiranjit Lal Chowdhurary  v. Union of India , AIR 1951 SC 41). The right\nto equality is also recognised as one of the basic features of the Constitution ( Indra Sawhney  v. Union of\nIndia , AIR 2000 SC 498).\nExample: A law has been passed for grant of financial assistance to women below the Age of 14 years for\neducation. It was contented that there shall be equality before the law. Can it be passed?\nYes, it can be passed if the Legislation is based on reasonable classification and intelligible diff erentia.\nProhibition of discrimination on grounds of religion etc.\nArticle 15(1) prohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on grounds only of:\n(a)Religion\n(b)Race\n(c)Caste\n(d)Sex\n(e)Place of birth or\n(f)Any of them\nArticle 15(2) lays down that no citizen shall be subjected to any disability, restriction or conditi on with\nregard to\u2014\n(a)Access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or\n(b)The use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort, maintained wholly or\npartially out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.\nArticle 15(3) and 15(4) and 15(5) and 15(6) create certain exceptions to the right guaranteed by Art icle\n15(1) and 15(2). Under Article 15(3) the State can make special provision for women and children. It  is\nunder this provision that courts have upheld the validity of legislation or executive orders discrim inating\nin favour of women ( Union of India  v. Prabhakaran , (1997) 2 SCC 633).\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 197\nArticle 15(4) permits the State to make special provision for the advancement of\u2014\n(a)Socially and educationally backward classes of citizens;\n(b)Scheduled Castes; and\n(c)Scheduled tribes.\nArticle 15(5) inserted in the Constitution of India by the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act ,\n2005, permits the State to make special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationa lly\nbackward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such s pecial\nprovisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational insti tutions,\nwhether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in\nclause (1) of article 30.\nFurther, Article 15(6) inserted in the Constitution of India by the Constitution (One Hundred and Th ird\nAmendment) Act, 2019, provides that nothing in this article or sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of artic le 19 or\nclause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State from making,\u2014\n(a)any special provision for the advancement of any economically weaker sections of citizens other\nthan the classes mentioned in clauses (4) and (5); and\n(b)any special provision for the advancement of any economically weaker sections of citizens other\nthan the classes mentioned in clauses (4) and (5) in so far as such special provisions relate to the ir\nadmission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided\nor unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1)\nof article 30, which in the case of reservation would be in addition to the existing reservations\nand subject to a maximum of ten per cent. of the total seats in each category.\nExplanation. \u2014For the purposes of Article 15 and Article 16, \"economically weaker sections\" shall be such\nas may be notified by the State from time to time on the basis of family income and other indicators  of\neconomic disadvantage.\nExample: Fundamental Right have been given to the citizens but they are not without any restrictions .\nCertain exceptions are also provided with the Fundamental rights.\nEquality of opportunity in matters of public employment\nArticle 16(1) guarantees to all citizens equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment o r\nappointment of office under the State.\nArticle 16(2) prohibits discrimination against a citizen on the grounds of religion, race, caste, se x descent,\nplace of birth or residence.\nHowever, there are certain exceptions provided in Article 16(3), 16(4) and 16(5). These are as under :\n(1)Parliament can make a law that in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an\noffice under the Government of a State or a Union Territory, under any local or other authority\nwithin the State or Union Territory, residence within that State or Union Territory prior to such\nemployment or appointment shall be an essential qualification. [Article 16(3)]\n(2)A provision can be made for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward\nclass of citizens which in the opinion of the State is not adequately represented in the services\nunder the State. [Article 16(4)]\n(3)Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters\nof promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the services under\n198 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\nthe State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the\nState, are not adequately represented in the services under the State. [Article 16(4A)]\n(4)Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from considering any unfilled vacancies of a year\nwhich are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation\nmade under clause (4) or clause (4A) as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any\nsucceeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the\nvacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per cen t.\nreservation on total number of vacancies of that year. [Article 16(4B)]\n(5)A law shall not be invalid if it provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the aff air\nof any religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall\nbe a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination. [Article\n16(5)]\n(6)Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of\nappointments or posts in favour of any economically weaker sections of citizens other than the\nclasses mentioned in clause (4), in addition to the existing reservation and subject to a maximum\nof ten per cent. of the posts in each category. [Article 16(6)]\nAbolition of untouchability\nArticle 17 says that \u201cUntouchability\u201d is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The en forcement\nof any disability arising out of \u201cUntouchability\u201d shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.\nUntouchability does not include an instigation to social boycott ( Davarajiah  v. Padamanna , AIR 1961\nMad. 35, 39). Punishment for violation of Article 17 is to be provided by Parliament under Article 3 5(a) (ii).\nAbolition of titles\nArticle 18 is more a prohibition rather than a fundamental right. British Government used to confer titles\nupon persons who showed special allegiance to them. Many persons were made Sir, Raj Bahadur, Rai\nSaheb, Knight, etc. These titles had the effect of creating a class of certain persons which was reg arded\nsuperior to others and thus had the effect of perpetuating inequality. To do away with that practice , Article\n18 provides as under:\n(i)No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State.\n(ii) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State.\n(iii) No person, who is not a citizen of India shall, while he holds any office or trust under the State,\naccept without the consent of the President, any title from any foreign State.\n(iv) No person, holding any office of profit or trust under State shall without the consent of the\nPresident, accept any present, emolument or office of any kind from or under a foreign State.\nRights Relating to Freedom\nArticles 19-22 guarantee certain fundamental freedoms.\nThe Six Freedoms of Citizens\nArticle 19(1), of the Constitution, guarantees to the citizens of India six freedoms, namely:\n(a)Freedom of speech and expression;\n(b)Assemble peaceably and without arms;\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 199\n(c)Form associations or unions or co-operative societies\n(d)Move freely, throughout the territory of India;\n(e)Reside and settle in any part of the territory of India;\n(f)Sub-clause (f) is omitted by section 2 of the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978;\n(g)practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.\nThese freedoms are those great and basic rights which are recognized as the natural rights inherent in the\nstatus of a citizen. At the same time, none of these freedoms is absolute but subject to reasonable restrictions\nspecified under clauses (2) to (6) of the Article 19. The Constitution under Articles 19(2) to 19(6)  permits\nthe imposition of restrictions on these freedoms subject to the following conditions:\n(a)The restriction can be imposed by law and not by a purely executive order issued under a statute;\n(b)The restriction must be reasonable;\n(c)The restriction must be imposed for achieving one or more of the objects specified in the respective\nclauses of Article 19.\nArticle 19(2) specifies the limits upto which the freedom of speech and expression may be restricted . It\nenables the Legislature to impose by law reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech and expres sion\nunder the following heads:\nPermissible Restrictions\n(1)Sovereignty and integrity of India\n(2)Security of the State\n(3)Friendly relations with foreign States\n(4)Public Order\n(5)Decency or morality\n(6)Contempt of court\n(7)Defamation\n(8)Incitement to an offence\nReasonable restrictions under these heads can be imposed only by a duly enacted law and not by the\nexecutive action [ Express News Papers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India, (1986) 1 SCC 133 ].\nExample: A certain class of persons were denied to form co-operative societies. They contended that it is\ntheir fundamental right to form co-operative societies. Is the contention correct?\nYes, it is the fundamental right of citizen to form co-operatives socities.\nProtection of Life and Personal Liberty\nArticle 21 confers on every person the fundamental right to life and personal liberty. It says that,\n\u201cNo person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure\nestablished by law .\u201d\nThe right to life includes those things which make life meaningful.

A.P.O. , New Delhi, AIR 1967 S.C. 1836, it was held that right to travel is\nincluded within the expression \u2018personal liberty\u2019 and, therefore, no person can be deprived of his r ight to\ntravel, except according to the procedure established by law. Since a passport is essential for the enjoyment\nof that right, the denial of a passport amounts to deprivation of personal liberty. In the absence o f any\nprocedure pescribed by the law of land sustaining the refusal of a passport to a person, it\u2019s refusa l amounts\nto an unauthorised deprivation of personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21.\nProcedure established by law : The expression \u2018procedure established by law\u2019 means procedure laid down\nby statute or procedure prescribed by the law of the State. Accordingly, first, there must be a law justifying\ninterference with the person\u2019s life or personal liberty, and secondly, the law should be a valid law , and\nthirdly, the procedure laid down by the law should have been strictly followed.The procedure must be\nfair, just and reasonable. It must not be arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive.\nRight to Education\nAccording to Article 21A of the Constitution of India, the State shall provide free and compulsory e ducation\nto all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determi ne.\nProtection against arrest and detention in certain cases\nAccording to Article 22 of the Constitution of India no arrested\nperson shall be detained in custody without being informed, of\nthe grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to\nconsult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.\nFurther, every arrested person and who is detained in custody\nshall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period\nof twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary\nfor the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the\nmagistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody\nbeyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.\nHowever, the protection is not available to an enemy alien and\na person arrested or detained under any law providing for\npreventive detention.\nRight against Exploitation\nAccording to, Article 23 of Constitution of India traffic in human\nbeings and begar and other similar forms of forced labour are\nprohibited and any contravention of Article 23 shall be an\noffence punishable in accordance with law. Further, as per\nArticle 24 of Constitution of India, no child below the age of\nfourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine\nor engaged in any other hazardous employment.\nRIGHT\nAGAINST\nEXPLOITATION\nProhibition of traffic in\nhuman beings and\nforced labour\nProhibition of\nemployment of\nchildren in factories,\netc.\n202 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\nRight to Freedom of Religion\nArticles 25, 26, 27 and 28 of Constitution of India deals with right to Freedom of Religion.\nRight to Constitutional Remedies\nArticle 32 guarantees the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. It is remedial and not substantive in\nnature. The rest of the Articles 33 to 35 relate to supplementary matters and do not create or guara ntee\nany right. Therefore, we shall discuss Article 32 first and then rest of the Articles i.e. 33-35 bri efly.\nRemedies for Enforcement of Fundamental Rights\nIt is a cardinal principle of jurisprudence that where there is a right there is a remedy (ubi jus i bi remedium)\nand if rights are given without there being a remedy for their enforcement, they are of no use. Whil e\nremedies are available in the Constitution and under the ordinary laws, Article 32 makes it a fundam ental\nright that a person whose fundamental right is violated has the right to move the Supreme Court by\nappropriate proceedings for the enforcement of his fundamental right. It is really a far reaching pr ovision\nin the sense that a person need not first exhaust the other remedies and then go to the Supreme Cour t.\nOn the other hand, he can directly raise the matter before highest Court of the land and the Supreme\nCourt is empowered to issue directions or orders or writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus,\nprohibition, quo warranto and certiorari , whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of the\nright, the violation of which has been alleged. This power of the Supreme Court to issue directions,  etc.,\nmay also be assigned to other Courts by Parliament without affecting the powers of the Supreme Court .\nThe right to move the Supreme Court is itself a guarantee right and the significance of this has bee n\nassessed by Gajendragadkar, J. in the following words:\n\u201cThe fundamental right to move this Court can therefore be appropriately described as the cornerston e\nof the democratic edifice raised by the Constitution. That is why it is natural that this Court shou ld, in the\nwords of Patanjali Sastri, J., regard itself \u2018as the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights\u2019,  and\nshould declare that \u201cit cannot, consistently with the responsibility laid upon it, refuse to enterta in\napplications seeking protection against infringements of such rights. In discharging the duties assi gned to\nit, this Court has to play the role of \u2018sentinel on the qui vive\u2019 ( State of Madras v. V .G.

State of U.P., AIR 1961 SC 1457 ).\nDIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY\nThe Sub-committee on Fundamental Rights constituted by the Constituent Assembly suggested two types\nof Fundamental Rights \u2014 one which can be enforced in the Courts of law and the other which because\nof their different nature cannot be enforced in the law Courts. Later on however, the former were pu t\nunder the head \u2018Fundamental Rights\u2019 as Part III which we have already discussed and the latter were put\nseparately in Part IV of the Constitution under the heading \u2018Directive Principles of State Policy\u2019 w hich are\ndiscussed in the following pages.\nThe Articles included in Part IV of the Constitution (Articles 36 to 51) contain certain Directives which are\nthe guidelines for the Government to lead the country. Article 37 provides that the \u2018provisions cont ained\nin this part (i) shall not be enforceable by any Court, but the principles therein laid down are nev erthless\n(ii) fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply the se\nprinciples in making laws. The Directives, however, differ from the fundamental rights contained in Part-\nIII of the Constitution or the ordinary laws of the land in the following respects:\n(i)The Directives are not enforceable in the courts and do not create any justiciable rights in favour\nof individuals.\n(ii) The Directives require to be implemented by legislation and so long as there is no law carrying\nout the policy laid down in a Directive, neither the state nor an individual can violate any existin g\nlaw .\n(iii) The Directives per-se  do not confer upon or take away any legislative power from the appropriate\nlegislature.\n(iv) The courts cannot declare any law as void on the ground that it contravenes any of the Directive\nPrinciples.\n(v) The courts are not competent to compel the Government to carry out any Directives or to make\nany law for that purpose.\n(vi) Though it is the duty of the state to implement the Directives, it can do so only subject to the\nlimitations imposed by the different provisions of the Constitution upon the exercise of the legisla tive\nand executive power by the state.\nImportant Directive Principles\nTo be specific, the important Directive Principles are enumerated below:\n(a)State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people:\n(1)The State must strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as\neffectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and political should\ninform all the institutions of the national life.\n(2)The State shall, in particular, strive to minimise the inequalities in income and endeavour to\neliminate inequalities in status, facilities, and opportunities, not only amongst individuals but\nalso among groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations.\n(Article 38).\n(b)Certain principles of policy to be followed by the State. The State, particularly, must direct its p olicy\ntowards securing:\n204 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\n(i)that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood;\n(ii) that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed\nas best to subserve the common goods;\n(iii) that the operation of the economic systems does not result in the concentration of wealth\nand means of production to the common detriment;\n(iv) equal pay for equal work for both men and women;\n(v) that the health and strength of workers and children is not abused and citizens are not\nforced by the economic necessity to enter avocation unsuited to their age or strength;\n(vi) that childhood, and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material\nabandonment (Article 39).\n(bb)The State shall secure that the operation of legal system promotes justice on a basis of equal\nopportunity, and shall, in particular provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in\nany other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by\nreason of economic or other disabilities (Article 39A).\n(c)The State must take steps to organise the Village Panchayats and enable them to function as units\nof self-government (Article 40).\n(d)Within the limits of economic capacity and development the State must make effective provision\nfor securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in case of unemployment, old\nage, etc. (Article 41).\n(e)Provision must be made for just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief (Article\n42).\n(f)The State must endeavour to secure living wage and good standard of life to all types of workers\nand must endeavour to promote cottage industries on an individual of co-operative basis in rural\nareas (Article 43).\n(ff)The State take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure the participation of\nworkers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged in\nany industry (Article 43A).\n(g)The State must endeavour to provide a uniform civil code for all Indian citizens (Article 44).\n(h)Provision for free and compulsory education for all children upto the age of fourteen years\n(Article 45).\n(i)The State must promote the educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled\nTribes and other weaker sections (Article 46).\n(j)The State must regard it one of its primary duties to raise the level of nutritional and the standar d\nof living and to improve public health and in particular it must endeavour to bring about\nprohibition of the consumption, except for medicinal purposes, in intoxicating drinks and of\ndrugs which are injurious to health (Article 47).\n(k)The State must organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and\nimprove the breeds and prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught\ncattle (Article 48).\n(kk)The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests\nand wild life of the country (Article 48A).\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 205\n(l)Protection of monuments and places and objects of national importance is obligatory upon the\nState (Article 49).\n(m)The State must separate executive from judiciary in the public services of the State (Article 50).\n(n)In international matters the State must endeavour to promote peace and security, maintain just\nand honourable relations in respect of international law between nations, treaty obligations and\nencourage settlement of international disputes by arbitration (Article 51).\nFUNDAMENTAL DUTIES\nArticle 51A imposes the fundamental duties on every citizen of India. These Fundamental Duties are:\n(a)to abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the\nNational Anthem;\n(b)To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;\n(c)to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;\n(d)to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;\n(e)to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India\ntranscending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices\nderogatory to the dignity of women;\n(f)to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;\n(g)to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and\nto have compassion for living creatures;\n(h)to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;\n(i)to safeguard public property and to abjure violene;\n(j)to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation\nconstantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement.\n(k)who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may\nbe, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.\nSince the duties are imposed upon the citizens and not upon the States, legislation is necessary for  their\nimplementation. Fundamental duties  can\u2019t be enforced by writs  ( Surya Narain  v. Union of India, AIR 1982\nRaj 1 ).\nCITIZENSHIP\n\"The State is a compound made of citizens; and this compels us to consider who should\nproperly be called a citizen and what a citizen really is. The nature of Citizenship like that of th e\nState, is a question which is often disputed; there is no general agreement on a single definition;\nthe man who is a citizen in democracy is often not one in an oligarchy.\"\n Aristotle\nNational citizenship remains an essential and enduring feature of modern life in terms of politics a nd\nelections, welfare state benefits, all round integration etc. Articles 5 to 9 of the Constitution de termine\nwho are the Indian citizens at the commencement of the Constitution. Article 10 provides for their\ncontinuance as such citizens subject to the provisions of any law that may be made by Parliament. Ar ticle\n206 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\n11 entrust the Parliament with powers to regulate the right of citizenship. In other words, the Cons titution\nunder Article 11 expressly left acquisition and termination of citizenship and all other matters rel ating\nthereto to the Parliament by way of legislation. The legislation related to this matter is the Citiz enship Act,\n1955.\nArticle 5: Citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution\nArticle 5 provides that at the commencement of the Constitution, every person who has his domicile i n\nthe territory of India and\u2014\n(a)Who was born in the territory of India; or\n(b)Either of whose parents was born in the territory of India; or\n(c)Who has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than five years immediately\npreceding such commencement, shall be a citizen of India.\nP ARLIAMENT\nThere shall be a Parliament for the\nUnion which shall consist of the\nPresident and two Houses to be known\nrespectively as the Council of States and\nthe House of the People.\nPresident\nThe President shall be elected by the\nmembers of an electoral college\nconsisting of\u2014 (a) the elected members\nof both Houses of Parliament; and (b)\nthe elected members of the Legislative\nAssemblies of the States.\nPowers of  the President\nArticle 53 the Constitution lays down\nthat the executive power of the union\nshall be vested in the President. The President of India shall, thus, be the head of the \u2018executive power\u2019 of\nthe union. The executive power may be defined as the power of \u201ccarrying on the business of Governmen t\u201d\nor \u201cthe administration of the affairs of the state\u201d excepting functions which are vested in any othe r\nauthority by the Constitution. Various powers that are included within the comprehensive expression\n\u2018executive power\u2019 in a modern state have been classified under following heads :\n(i)Administrative power, i.e., the execution of the laws and the administration of the departments of\nGovernment.\n(ii) Military power, i.e., the command of the armed forces and the conduct of war.\n(iii) Legislative power, i.e., the summoning prorogation, etc. of the legislature.\n(iv) Judicial power, i.e., granting of pardons, reprieves etc. to persons convicted of crime.\nThese powers vest in the President under each of these heads, subject to the limitations made under the\nConstitution.PARLIAMENTPresident\nCouncil\nof\nStatesHouse\nof the\nPeople\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 207\nPower to Promulgate Ordinance\nThe most important legislative power conferred on the President is to promulgate Ordinances. Article  123\nof the Constitution provides that the President shall have the power to legislate by Ordinances at a ny time\nwhen it is not possible to have a parliamentary enactment on the subject, immediately. This is a spe cial\nfeature of the Constitution of India.\nThe ambit of this Ordinance-making power of the President is co-extensive with the legislative power s of\nParliament, that is to say it may relate to any subject in respect of which Parliament has the right  to legislate\nand is subject to the same constitutional limitations as legislation by Parliament.\nRajya Sabha (Council of States)\nThe Council of States shall consists of twelve members to be nominated by the President and not more\nthan two hundred and thirty-eight representatives of the States and of the Union territories.\nThe allocation of seats in the Council of States to be filled by representatives of the States and o f the Union\nterritories shall be in accordance with the provisions in that behalf contained in the Fourth Schedu le of\nthe Constitution.  The members to be nominated by the President shall consist of persons having spec ial\nknowledge or practical experience in respect of literature, science, art and social service. The\nrepresentatives of each State in the Council of States shall be elected by the elected members of th e\nLegislative Assembly of the State in accordance with the system of proportional representation by me ans\nof the single transferable vote. The representatives of the Union territories in the Council of Stat es shall be\nchosen in such manner as Parliament may by law prescribe.\nLok Sabha (House of the People)\nLok Sabha is composed of representatives of the people chosen by direct election on the basis of the  adult\nsuffrage. The maximum strength of the House envisaged by the Constitution is 552, which is made up b y\nelection of upto 530 members to represent the States, upto 20 members to represent the Union Territo ries\nand not more than two members of the Anglo-Indian Community to be nominated by the Hon'ble\nPresident, if, in his/her opinion, that community is not adequately represented in the House. The to tal\nelective membership is distributed among the States in such a way that the ratio between the number of\nseats allotted to each State and the population of the State is, so far as practicable, the same for  all States.\nCOUNCIL OF MINISTERS\nThere shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the Pres ident\nwho shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice. The Prime Minister shall be\nappointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice  of\nthe Prime Minister. The total number of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, in the Council of M inisters\nshall not exceed fifteen per cent. of the total number of members of the House of the People.\nThe Ministers shall continuation office at the pleasure of the President. The Council of Ministers s hall be\ncollectively responsible to the House of the People. Before a Minister enters upon his office, the P resident\nshall administer to him the oaths of office and of secrecy. The salaries and allowances of Ministers  shall be\nsuch as Parliament may from time to time by law determine and, until Parliament so determines, shall  be\nas specified in the Second Schedule.\nThe total number of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, in the Council of\nMinisters shall not exceed fifteen per cent of the total number of members of the\nHouse of the People.\n208 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\nCONSTITUTION OF LEGISLATURES IN STATES\nFor every State there shall be a Legislature which shall consist of the Governor, and\n(i)in the States of Andhra\nPradesh, Bihar, Madhya\nPradesh, Maharashtra,\nKarnataka, Tamil Nadu,\nTelangana and Uttar\nPradesh having two\nHouses\n(ii) in other States, one House.\nWhere there are two Houses of the\nLegislature of a State, one shall be\nknown as the Legislative Council\nand the other as the Legislative\nAssembly, and where there is only\none House, it shall be known as the\nLegislative Assembly.\nThe Legislative Assembly of each\nState shall consist of not more than\nfive hundred, and not less than sixty,\nmembers chosen by direct election\nfrom territorial constituencies in the\nState.  The total number of members\nin the Legislative Council of a State\nhaving such a Council shall not\nexceed one third of the total\nnumber of members in the\nLegislative Assembly of that State.\nThe total number of members in the\nLegislative Council of a State shall\nin no case be less than forty.\nLegislative Assembly of every State,\nunless sooner dissolved, shall\ncontinue for five years from the date\nappointed for its first meeting and\nno longer and the expiration of the\nsaid period of five years shall operate\nas a dissolution of the Assembly. The\nLegislative Council of a State shall\nnot be subject to dissolution, but as\nnearly as possible one third of the\nmembers thereof shall retire as soon as may be on the expiration of every second year in accordance with\nthe provisions made in that behalf by Parliament by law.\nGOVERNOR\nThe executive power of the State is vested in the Governor and all executive action of the State has  to be\ntaken in the name of the Governor. Normally there shall be a Governor for each State but the same pe rsonSTATES HAVING LEGISLATIVE\nCOUNCIL\nAndhra Pradesh\nBihar\nMadhya Pradesh\nMaharashtra\nKarnataka\nTamil Nadu\nUttar Pradesh\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 209\ncan be appointed as Governor for two or more states. The Governor of a State is not elected but is\nappointed by the President and holds his office at the pleasure of the President. The head of the ex ecutive\npower to a State is the Governor just as the President for the Union.\nThe Governor possesses executive, legislation and judicial powers as the Presidents except that he h as no\ndiplomate or military powers like the President.\nThe Governor\u2019s power to make Ordinances as given under Article 213 is similar to the Ordinance makin g\npower of the President and have the force of an Act of the State Legislature. He can make Ordinance only\nwhen the state Legislature or either of the two Houses (where it is bicameral) is not in session. He  must be\nsatisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action. While exercis ing\nthis power, the Governor must act with the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers. But in follow ing\ncases, the Governor cannot promulgate any Ordinance without instructions from the President:\n(a)if a Bill containing the same provisions would under this constitution  have required the previous\nsanction of the President.\n(b)he would have deemed it necessary to reserve  a Bill containing the same provisions for the\nconsideration of the President.\n(c)an Act of the state legislature containing the same provisions would under this constitution have\nbeen invalid under having been reserved for the consideration of the President, it had received\nthe assent of the President.\nThe Ordinance must be laid before the state legislature (when it re-assembles) and shall automatical ly\ncease to have effect at the expiration of six weeks from the date of the re-assembly unless disappro ved\nearlier by that legislature.\nTHE JUDICIARY\nThe Supreme Court\nThe Courts in the Indian\nlegal system, broadly\nspeaking, consist of (i) the\nSupreme Court, (ii) the High\nCourts, and (iii) the\nSubordinate Courts. The\nSupreme Court, which is the\nhighest Court in the country\n(both for matters of ordinary\nlaw and for interpreting the\nConstitution) is an\ninstitution created by the\nConstitution. Immediately\nbefore independence, the\nPrivy Council was the\nhighest appellate authority\nfor British India, for matters\narising under ordinary law.\nBut appeals from High\nCourts in constitutional\nmatters lay to the Federal\nCourt (created under theSUPREME\nCOURT OF\nINDIA\nHIGH COURT\nDistrict and Sub-\nordinate Courts\nCivil Courts Criminal Courts\n210 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\nGovernment of India Act, 1935) and thence to the Privy Council. The Supreme Court of India, in this\nsense, has inherited the jurisdiction of both the Privy Council and the Federal Court. However, the\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the present Constitution is much more extensive than that of  its\ntwo predecessors mentioned above.\nThe Supreme Court, entertains appeals (in civil and criminal and other cases) from High Courts and\ncertain Tribunals. It has also writ jurisdiction for enforcing Fundamental Rights. It can advise the  President\non a reference made by the President on questions of fact and law. It has a variety of other special\njurisdictions.\nHigh Courts\nThe High Courts that function under the Constitution were not created for the first time by the Cons titution.\nSome High Courts existed before the Constitution, although some new High Courts have been created\nafter 1950. The High Courts in (British) India were established first under the Indian High Courts A ct, 1861\n(an Act of the U.K. Parliament). The remaining High Courts were established or continued under the\nConstitution or under special Acts. High Courts for each State (or Group of States) have appellate, civil\nand criminal jurisdiction over lower Courts. High Courts have writ jurisdiction to enforce fundament al\nrights and for certain other purposes.\nSome High Courts (notably) Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi, have ordinary original civil jurisdiction (i. e.\njurisdiction to try regular civil suits) for their respective cities. High Courts can also hear refe rences made\nby the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal under the Income Tax Act and other tribunals.\nIt should be added, that the \"writ\" jurisdiction vested at present in all High Courts by the Constit ution was\n(before the Constitution came into force) vested only in the High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta and Mad ras\n(i.e. the three Presidency towns).\nSubordinate Courts\nFinally, there are various subordinate civil and criminal courts (original and appellate), functioni ng under\nordinary law. Although their nomenclature and powers have undergone change from time to time, the\nbasic pattern remains the same. These have been created, not under the Constitution, but under laws of\nthe competent legislature. Civil Courts are created mostly under the Civil Courts Act of each State.\nCriminal courts are created mainly under the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nCivil Courts\nIn each district, there is a District Court presided over by the District Judge, with a number of Ad ditional\nDistrict Judges attached to the court. Below that Court are Courts of Judges (sometimes called subor dinate\nJudges) and in, some States, Munsiffs. These Courts are created under State Laws.\nCriminal Courts\nCriminal courts in India primarily consist of the Magistrate and the Courts of Session. Magistrates themselves\nhave been divided by the Code of Criminal Procedure into 'Judicial' and 'Executive' Magistrates.\nExecutive Magistrate\nThe Executive Magistrate do not try criminal prosecutions, and their jurisdiction is confined to cer tain\nmiscellaneous cases, which are of importance for public tranquillity and the like. Their proceedings  do\nnot end in conviction or acquittal, but in certain other types of restrictive orders. In some States , by local\namendments, Executive Magistrates have been vested with powers to try certain offences.\nJudicial Magistrate\nJudicial Magistrates, are of two classes: Second Class and First Class. Judicial Magistrates are sub ject to\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 211\nthe control of the Court of Session, which also in itself a Court of original jurisdiction. The powe rs of\nMagistrates of the two classes, vary according to their grade. The Court of Session can try all offe nces, and\nhas power to award any sentence, prescribed by law for the offence, but a sentence of death requires\nconfirmation by the High Court.\nIn some big cities (including the three Presidency towns and Ahmedabad and Delhi), the Magistrates a re\ncalled Metropolitan Magistrates. There is no gradation inter se. Further, in some big cities (includ ing the\nthree Presidency towns and Ahmedabad and Hyderabad), the Sessions Court is called the \"City Sessions\nCourt\", its powers being the same as those of the Courts of Session in the districts.\nSpecial Tribunals\nBesides these Courts, which form part of the general judicial set up, there are hosts of specialised  Tribunals\ndealing with Direct Taxes, Labour, Customs, Claims for accidents caused by motor vehicles, Copyright\nand Environment, Anti- Competitive Agreement etc.\nWRIT JURISDICTION OF HIGH COURTS AND SUPREME COURT\nUnder the Constitution by virtue of Article 226, every High Court has the power to issue directions or\norders or writs including writs in the nature of Habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo warranto\nand Certiorari or any of them for the enforcement of fundamental rights stipulated in Part III of th e\nConstitution or for any other purpose. This power is exercisable by each High Court throughout the\nterritory in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction.\nA person can also approach the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the issue of directions or\norders or writs, as referred to under Article 226 for the enforcement of the rights guaranteed by Pa rt III of\nthe Constitution. Article 32 itself being a fundamental right, the Constitutional remedy of writ is available\nto anyone whose fundamental rights are infringed by state action.\nTypes of Writs\nA brief description of the various types\nof writs is given below:\n1.Habeas Corpus\nThe writ of Habeas corpus -\nan effective bulwark of\npersonal liberty \u2013 is a remedy\navailable to a person who is\nconfined without legal\njustification. The words\n\u2018Habeas Corpus\u2019 literally\nmean \u201cto have the body\u201d.\nWhen a prima facie case for\nthe issue of writ has been\nmade then the Court issues a\nrule nisi upon the relevant\nauthority to show cause why\nthe writ should not be issued.\nThis is in national order to let\nthe Court know on what\ngrounds he has been\nconfined and to set him free if\nthere is no justification for his\nWRITSHabeas Corpus\nQuo WarrantoMandamus\nProhibition Certiorari\n212 Legal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\ndetention. This writ has to be obeyed by the detaining authority by producing the person before\nthe Court. Under Articles 32 and 226 any person can move for this writ to the Supreme Court and\nHigh Court respectively. The applicant may be the prisoner or any person acting on his behalf to\nsafeguard his liberty for the issuance of the writ of Habeas Corpus as no man can be punished or\ndeprived of his personal liberty except for violation of law and in the ordinary legal manner. An\nappeal to the Supreme Court of India may lie against an order granting or rejecting the application\n(Articles 132, 134 or 136). The disobedience to this writ is met with by punishment for contempt\nof Court under the Contempt of Courts Act.\n2.Mandamus\nThe word \u2018Mandamus\u2019 literally means we command. The writ of mandamus is, a command\nissued to direct any person, corporation, inferior court, or Government requiring him or it do a\nparticular thing specified therein which pertains to his or its office and is further in the nature of\na public duty. This writ is used when the inferior tribunal has declined to exercise jurisdiction\nwhile resort to certiorari and prohibition arises when the tribunal has wrongly exercised\njurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction and are available only against judicial and quasi-judicial\nbodies. Mandamus can be issued against any public authority. It commands activity. The writ is\nused for securing judicial enforcement of public duties. In a fit case, Court can direct executives\nto carry out Directive Principles of the Constitution through this writ (State of Maharashtra v. MP\nVashi, 1995 (4) SCALE). The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty\nby the person against whom the writ is prayed for. It is not issued if the authority has a discretio n.\nThe Constitution of India by Articles 226 and 32 enables mandamus to be issued by the High\nCourts and the Supreme Court to all authorities.\n3.Prohibition\nA writ of prohibition is issued to an Inferior Court preventing the latter from usurping jurisdictio n\nwhich is not legally vested in it. When a tribunal acts without or in excess of jurisdiction, or in\nviolation of rules or law, a writ of prohibition can be asked for. It is generally issued before the  trial\nof the case.\nWhile mandamus commands activity, prohibition commands inactivity, it is available only against\njudicial or quasi-judicial authorities and is not available against a public officer who is not vest ed\nwith judicial functions. If abuse of power is apparent this writ may be of right and not a matter of\ndiscretion.\n4.Certiorari\nIt is available to any person, wherever anybody of persons having legal authority to determine\nquestions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially in excess of their\nlegal authority\u201d (See The King  v. Electricity Commissioners , (1924) I.K.B. 171, P. 204-5).\nThe writ removes the proceedings from such body to the High Court, to quash a decision that\ngoes beyond its jurisdiction. Under the Constitution of India, all High Courts can issue the writ of\ncertiorari throughout their territorial jurisdiction when the subordinate judicial authority acts (i )\nwithout or in excess of jurisdiction or (ii) in contravention of the rules of natural justice or (ii i)\ncommits an error apparent on the face of the record. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to\nissue such writs arises under Article 32. Although the object of both the writs of prohibition and o f\ncertiorari is the same, prohibition is available at an earlier stage whereas certiorari is available  at\na later stage but on similar grounds i.e. Certiorari is issued after authority has exercised its pow ers.\n5.Quo Warranto\nThe writ of quo warranto enables enquiry into the legality of the claim which a person asserts, to\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 213\nan office or franchise and to oust him from such position if he is an usurper. The holder of the\noffice has to show to the court under what authority he holds the office. It is issued when:\n(i)the office is of public and of a substantive nature,\n(ii) created by statute or by the Constitution itself, and\n(iii) the respondent has asserted his claim to the office. It can be issued even though he has not\nassumed the charge of the office.\nThe fundamental basis of the proceeding of Quo warranto is that the public has an interest to see\nthat a lawful claimant does not usurp a public office. It is a discretionary remedy which the court\nmay grant or refuse.\nMAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS 1951 - 2022\nThe Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951\n\u2014Added Ninth Schedule to protect the land reform and other laws included in it from the judicial\nreview.\n\u2014Added three more grounds of restrictions on freedom of speech and expression, viz., public\norder, friendly relations with foreign states and incitement to an offence.

INDIAN CONTRACT ACT\nINTRODUCTION\nA contract is an agreement enforceable at law, made between two or more persons, by which rights are\nacquired by one or more to acts or forbearances on the part of the other or others. A contract is an\nagreement creating and defining obligations between the parties.\nThe Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays down general principles relating to formation and enforceability of\ncontracts; rules governing the provisions of an agreement and offer; the various types of contracts including\nthose of indemnity and guarantee, bailment and pledge and agency. It also contains provisions pertai ning\nto breach of a contract.\nThe Law of Contract constitutes the most important branch of Mercantile or Commercial Law. It affect s\neverybody, more so, trade, commerce and industry.  It may be said that the contract is the foundatio n of\nthe civilized world.\nThe Indian Contract Act, 1872 came into force on the first day of September, 1872. The preamble to t he\nAct says that it is an Act \u201cto define and amend certain parts of the law relating to contract\u201d. The Act is by\nno means exhaustive on the law of contract. It does not deal with all the branches of the law of con tract.\nThus, contracts relating to partnership, sale of goods, negotiable instruments, insurance etc. are d ealt\nwith by separate Acts. The Indian Contract Act majorly deals with the general principles and rules g overning\ncontracts. The Act is divisible into two parts:\n\u2014The first part (Section 1-75) deals with the general principles of the law of contract, and therefor e\napplies to all contracts irrespective of their nature.\n\u2014The second part (Sections 124-238) deals with certain special kinds of contracts, namely contracts\nof Indemnity and Guarantee, Bailment, Pledge, and Agency.\nCONTR ACT\nThe Indian Contract Act has defined \u201cContract\u201d in Section 2(h) as \u201can agreement enforceable by law\u201d.\nThis definition indicate that a contract essentially consists of two distinct parts. First, there mu st be an\nagreement. Secondly, such an agreement must be enforceable by law. To be enforceable, an agreement\nmust be coupled with an obligation. A contract therefore, is a combination of the two elements:\n\u2014An agreement,  and\n\u2014An obligation.\nAGREEMENT\nAn agreement gives birth to a contract. As per Section 2(e) of the Indian Contract Act every promise  and\nevery set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement .\nIt is evident from the definition given above that an agreement is based on a promise. What is a pro mise?\nAccording to Section 2(b) of the Indian Contract Act \u201cwhen the person to whom the proposal is made\nsignifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, become s a promise .\nAn agreement, therefore, comes into existence when one party makes a proposal or offer to the other\nparty and that other party signifies his assent thereto. In a nutshell, an agreement is the sum tota l of offer\nand acceptance.\u201d\nExample: A orally agreed to supply 50 Kg Rice of a certain brand and quality to Mr. B and to receive\npayment against it. Is it an agreement?\nYes, it is an agreement.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 217\nAn analysis of the definition given above reveals the following characteristics of an agreement:\nOBLIG ATION\nAn obligation is the legal duty to do or abstain from doing what one has promised to do or abstain f rom\ndoing. A contractual obligation arises from a bargain between the parties to the agreement who are\ncalled the promisor and the promisee. Section 2(b) says that when the person to whom the proposal is\nmade signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted; and a proposal when accepted\nbecomes a promise. In broad sense, therefore, a contract is an exchange of promises by two or more\npersons, resulting in an obligation to do or abstain from doing a particular act, where such obligat ion is\nrecognised and enforced by law.\nRights and Obligations\nWhere parties have made a binding contract, they have created rights and obligations between themsel ves.\nThe contractual rights and obligations are correlative, e.g., A agrees with B to sell his car for Rs .10, 00.000/\n- to him. In this example, the following rights and obligations have been created:\n(i)A is under an obligation to deliver the car to B. B has a corresponding right to receive the car.\n(ii) B is under an obligation to pay Rs.10, 00,000/- to A. A has a correlative right to receive Rs.10,\n00,000/-.\nAgreements which are not Contracts\nAgreements in which the idea of bargain is absent and there is no intention to create legal relation s are\nnot contracts. These are:\n(a)Agreements relating to social matters  : An agreement between two persons to go together to the\ncinema, or for a walk, does not create a legal obligation on their part to abide by it. Similarly, i f I\npromise to take you for dinner and break that promise, I do not expect to be liable to legal\npenalties. There cannot be any offer and acceptance to hospitality.There must be two or more\npersons to make an agreement\nbecause one person cannot enter\ninto an agreement with himselfPlurality of\npersons\nThe meeting of the minds is called\ncouseusus-ad-idem. It means\nboth the parties to an agreement\nmust agree about the subject\nmatter of the agreement in the\nsame sense and at the same timeConsensus ad\nidemAgreement\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 218\n(b)Domestic arrangements between husband and wife : In Balfour v . Balfour (1919) 2 KB 571, a husband\nworking in Ceylone, had agreed in writing to pay a housekeeping allowance to his wife living in\nEngland. On receiving information that she was unfaithful to him, he stopped the allowance. He\nwas held to be entitled to do so. This was a mere domestic arrangement with no intention to\ncreate legally binding relations. Therefore, there was no contract.\nThree consequences follow from the above discussion\n\u2014To constitute a contract, the parties must intend to create legal relationship.\n\u2014The law of contract is the law of those agreements which create obligations, and those obligations\nhave their source in agreement.\n\u2014Agreement is the genus of which contract is the specie and, therefore, all contracts are agreements\nbut all agreements are not contracts.\nEssential Elements of a Valid Contract\nSection 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides that \u201call agreements are contracts if they are made\nby the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful o bject,\nand are not hereby expressly declared to be void\u201d.\nThe essential elements of a valid contract are:\n(i)An offer or proposal by one party and acceptance of that offer by another party resulting in an\nAgreement \u2014 consensus-ad-idem.\n(ii) An intention to create legal relations or an intent to have legal consequences.\n(iii) The agreement is supported by a lawful consideration.\n(iv) The parties to the contract are legally capable of contracting.\n(v) Genuine consent between the parties.\n(vi) The object and consideration of the contract is legal and is not opposed to public policy.\n(vii) The terms of the contract are certain.\n(viii) The agreement is capable of being performed i.e., it is not impossible of being performed.\nTherefore, to form a valid contract there must be:\n\u2014An agreement\n\u2014Based on the genuine consent of the parties\n\u2014Supported by a lawful consideration\n\u2014Made for a lawful object, and\n\u2014Between the competent parties.\nExample: There is an agreement with a term that A will provide 50 kg of Wheat on a price of more tha n\nRs. Per 50 Kg?\nAn agreement cannot be on ambiguous terms. Therefore, this agreement is not valid.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 219\nOffer or Proposal and Acceptance\nOne of the early steps in the formation of a contract lies in arriving at an agreement between the c ontracting\nparties by means of an offer and acceptance. Thus, when one party (the offeror) makes a definite pro posal\nto another party (the offeree) and the offeree accepts it in its entirety and without any qualificat ion, there\nis a meeting of the minds of the parties and a contract comes into being, assuming that all other el ements\nare also present.\nA proposal is also termed as an offer. The word \u2018proposal\u2019 is synonymous with the English word \u201coffe r\u201d. An\noffer is a proposal by one person, whereby he expresses his willingness to enter into a contractual obligation\nin return for a promise, act or forbearance. Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act defines proposa l or\noffer as \u201cwhen one person signifies to another his willingness to do or abstain from doing anything with a\nview to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal\u201d . The\nperson making the proposal or offer is called the proposer or offeror and the person to whom the pro posal\nis made is called the offeree.\nRules Governing Offers\nA valid offer must comply with the following rules:\n(a)An offer must be clear, definite, complete and final. It must not be vague. For example, a promise\nto pay an increased price for a horse if it proves lucky to promisor, is too vague and is not bindin g.\n(b)An offer must be communicated to the offeree. An offer becomes effective only when it has been\ncommunicated to the offeree so as to give him an opportunity to accept or reject the same.\n(c)The communication of an offer may be made by express words-oral or written-or it may be\nimplied by conduct.\n(d)The communication of the offer may be general or specific. Where an offer is made to a specific\nperson it is called specific offer and it can be accepted only by that person. But when an offer is\naddressed to an uncertain body of individuals i.e. the world at large, it is a general offer and can\nbe accepted by any member of the general public by fulfilling the condition laid down in the offer\u2019.\nLapse of Offer\nSection 6 deals with various modes of lapse of an offer. It states that an offer lapses if\u2014\n(a)It is not accepted within the specified time (if any) or after a reasonable time, if none is specifi ed.\n(b)It is not accepted in the mode prescribed or if no mode is prescribed in some usual and reasonable\nmanner, e.g., by sending a letter by mail when early reply was requested;\n(c)The offeree rejects it by distinct refusal to accept it;\n(d)Either the offeror or the offeree dies before acceptance;\n(e)The acceptor fails to fulfil a condition precedent to an acceptance.\n(f)The offeree makes a counter offer, it amounts to rejection of the offer and an offer by the offeree\nmay be accepted or rejected by the offeror.\nRevocation of Offer by the Offeror\n\u2014An offer may be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance.\n\u2014Revocation must be communicated to the offeree, as it does not take effect until it is actually\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 220\ncommunicated to the offeree. Before its actual communication, the offeree, may accept the offer\nand create a binding contract. The revocation must reach the offeree before he sends out the\nacceptance.\n\u2014An offer to keep open for a specified time (option) is not binding unless it is supported by\nconsideration.\nAcceptance\nA contract emerges from the acceptance of an offer. Acceptance is the act of assenting by the offere e to\nan offer. Under Section 2(b) of the Contract Act when a person to whom the proposal is made signifie s his\nassent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted becomes a promise.\nRules Governing Acceptance\n(a)Acceptance may be express i.e. by words spoken or written or implied from the conduct of the\nparties.\n(b)If a particular method of acceptance is prescribed, the offer must be accepted in the prescribed\nmanner.\n(c)Acceptance must be unqualified and absolute and must correspond with all the terms of the offer.\n(d)A counter offer or conditional acceptance operates as a rejection of the offer and causes it to\nlapse, e.g., where a horse is offered for Rs.1,000 and the offeree counter-offers Rs.990, the offer\nlapses by rejection.\n(e)Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror, for acceptance is complete the moment it is\ncommunicated. Where the offeree merely intended to accept but does not communicate his\nintention to the offeror, there is no contract. Mere mental acceptance is not enough.\n(f)Mere silence on the part of the offeree does not amount to acceptance.\nOrdinarily, the offeror cannot frame his offer in such a way as to make the silence or inaction of\nthe offeree as an acceptance. In other words, the offeror can prescribe the mode of acceptance\nbut not the mode of rejection.\n(g)If the offer is one which is to be accepted by being acted upon, no communication of acceptance\nto the offeror is necessary, unless communication is stipulated for in the offer itself.\nThus, if a reward is offered for finding a lost dog, the offer is accepted by finding the dog after\nreading about the offer, and it is unnecessary before beginning to search for the dog to give\nnotice of acceptance to the offeror.\n(h)Acceptance must be given within a reasonable time and before the offer lapses or is revoked. An\noffer becomes irrevocable by acceptance.\nAn acceptance never precedes an offer. There can be no acceptance of an offer which is not\ncommunicated. Similarly, performance of conditions of an offer without the knowledge of the\nspecific offer, is no acceptance.\nContracts over the Telephone\nContracts over the telephone are regarded the same in principle as those negotiated by the parties i n the\nactual presence of each other. In both cases an oral offer is made and an oral acceptance is expecte d. It\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 221\nis important that the acceptance must be audible, heard and understood by the offeror. If during the\nconversation the telephone lines go \u201cdead\u201d and the offeror does not hear the offeree\u2019s word of accep tance,\nthere is no contract at the moment. If the whole conversation is repeated and the offeror hears and\nunderstands the words of acceptance, the contract is complete (Kanhaiyalal v. Dineshwarchandra (1959 )\nAIR, M.P . 234).\nIntention to Create Legal Relations\nThe second essential element of a valid contract is that there must be an intention among the partie s that\nthe agreement should be attached by legal consequences and create legal obligations. If there is no such\nintention on the part of the parties, there is no contract between them. Agreements of a social or d omestic\nnature do not contemplate legal relationship. As such they are not contracts.\nA proposal or an offer is made with a view to obtain the assent to the other party and when that oth er party\nexpresses his willingness to the act or abstinence proposed, he accepts the offer and a contract is made\nbetween the two. But both offer and acceptance must be made with the intention of creating legal\nrelations between the parties. The test of intention is objective. The Courts seek to give effect to  the\npresumed intention of the parties. Where necessary, the Court would look into the conduct of the par ties,\nfor much can be inferred from the conduct. The Court is not concerned with the mental intention of t he\nparties, rather  what a reasonable man would say, was the intention of the parties, having regard to  all the\ncircumstances of the case.\nFor example, if two persons agree to assist each other by rendering advice, in the pursuit of virtue , science\nor art, it cannot be regarded as a contract. In commercial and business agreements, the presumption is\nusually that the parties intended to create legal relations. But this presumption is rebuttable whic h means\nthat it must be shown that the parties did not intend to be legally bound.\nConsideration\nConsideration is one of the essential elements of a valid contract. The requirement of consideration  stems\nfrom the policy of extending the arm of the law to the enforcement of mutual promises of parties. A mere\npromise is not enforceable at law . For example, if A promises to make a gift of Rs. 500 to B, and su bsequently\nchanges his mind, B cannot succeed against A for breach of promise, as B has not given anything in\nreturn.\nIt is only when a promise is made for something in return from the promisee, that such promise can b e\nenforced by law against the promisor. This something in return is the consideration for the promise.\nSir Fredrick Pollock has defined consideration \u201cas an act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof\nis the price for which the promise of the other is bought\u201d .\nIt is \u201csome right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, detriment , loss or\nresponsibility, given, suffered or undertaken by the other\u201d ( Currie  v. Misa (1875) L.R. 10 Ex. 153).\nSection 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines consideration thus: \u201cwhen at the desire of the promisor,\nthe promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, o r promises\nto do or to abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideratio n for the\npromise\u201d.\nThe fundamental principle that consideration is essential in every contract, is laid down by both th e\ndefinitions but there are some important points of difference in respect of the nature and extent of\nconsideration and parties to it under the two systems:\n(a)Consideration at the desire of the promisor : Section 2(d) of the Act begins with the statement that\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 222\nconsideration must move at the desire or request of the promisor. This means that whatever is\ndone must have been done at the desire of the promisor and not voluntarily or not at the desire\nof a third party. If A rushes to B\u2019s help whose house is on fire, there is no consideration but a\nvoluntary act. But if A goes to B\u2019s help at B\u2019s request, there is good consideration as B did not wi sh\nto do the act gratuitously.\n(b)Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person : In English law , consideration must\nmove from the promisee, so that a stranger to the consideration cannot sue on the contract. A\nperson seeking to enforce a simple contract must prove in court that he himself has given the\nconsideration in return for the promise he is seeking to enforce.\nIn Indian law, however, consideration may move from the promisee or any other person, so that a\nstranger to the consideration may maintain a suit. In Chinnaya v. Ramaya, (1882) 4 Mad. 137, a lady by a\ndeed of gift made over certain property to her daughter directing her to pay an annuity to the donor s\nbrother as had been done by the donor herself before she gifted the property. On the same day, her\ndaughter executed in writing in favour of the donors brother agreeing to pay the annuity. Afterwards  the\ndonee (the daughter) declined to fulfil her promise to pay her uncle saying that no consideration ha d\nmoved from him. The Court, however, held that the uncle could sue even though no part of the\nconsideration received by his niece moved from him. The consideration from her mother was sufficient\nconsideration.\nExample: A & B, entered into a contract in which A will send goods to B free of cost and B is not re quired\nto do anything against it. Is the contract valid?\nNo, a valid contract must have consideration.\nPrivity of Contract\nA stranger to a contract cannot sue both under the English and Indian law for want of privity of con tract.\nThe following illustration explains this point.\nIn Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge Ltd. (1915) A.C. 847 , D supplied tyres to a wholesaler X, on\ncondition that any retailer to whom X re-supplied the tyres should promise X, not to sell them to th e public\nbelow Ds list price. X supplied tyres to S upon this condition, but nevertheless S sold the tyres be low the list\nprice. Held: There was a contract between D and X and a contract between X and S. Therefore, D could\nnot obtain damages from S, as D had not given any consideration for Ss promise to X nor was he party  to\nthe contract between D and X.\nThus, a person who is not a party to a contract cannot sue upon it even though the contract is for h is\nbenefit. A, who is indebted to B, sells his property to C, and C the purchaser of the property, prom ises to pay\noff the debt to B. In case C fails to pay B, B has no right to sue C for there is no privity of cont ract between\nB and C.\nKinds of Consideration\nConsideration may be:\n(a)Executory or future which means that it makes the form of promise to be performed in the future,\ne.g., an engagement to marry someone; or\n(b)Executed or present in which it is an act or forbearance made or suffered for a promise. In other\nwords, the act constituting consideration is wholly or completely performed, e.g., if A pays today\nRs.100 to a shopkeeper for goods which are promised to be supplied the next day, A has executed\nhis consideration but the shopkeeper is giving executory consideration\u2014a promise to be executed\nthe following day. If the price is paid by the buyer and the goods are delivered by the seller at th e\nsame time, consideration is executed by both the parties.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 223\n(c)Past which means a past act or forbearance, that is to say, an act constituting consideration which\ntook place and is complete (wholly executed) before the promise is made.\nRules Governing Consideration\n(a)Every simple contact must be supported by valuable consideration otherwise it is formally void\nsubject to some exceptions.\n(b)Consideration may be an act of abstinence or promise.\n(c)There must be mutuality i.e., each party must do or agree to do something. A gratuitous promise\nas in the case of subscription for charity, is not enforceable.\n(d)Consideration must be real, and not vague, indefinite, or illusory, e.g., a son\u2019s promise to \u201cstop\nbeing a nuisance\u201d to his father, being vague, is no consideration.\n(e)Although consideration must have some value, it need not be adequate i.e., a full return for the\npromise. Section 25 (Exp. II) clearly provides that \u201can agreement to which the consent of the\npromisor is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate.\n(f)Consideration must be lawful, e.g., it must not be some illegal act such as paying someone to\ncommit a crime. If the consideration is unlawful, the agreement is void.\n(g)Consideration must be something more than the promisee is already bound to do for the promisor.\nThus, an agreement to perform an existing obligation made with the person to whom the obligation\nis already owed, is not made for consideration\nWhen Consideration not Necessary\nThe general rule is that an agreement made without consideration is void. But Section 25 of the Indi an\nContract Act lays down certain exceptions which make a promise without consideration valid and bindi ng.\nThus, an agreement without consideration is valid:\nIf it is expressed in writing and registered and is made out of natural love and\naffection between parties standing in a near relation to each other; or\nIf it is made to compensate a person who has already done something\nvoluntarily for the promisor, or done something which the promisor was legally\ncompellable to do; or\nIf it is promise in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or\nby his agent, to pay a debt barred by the law of limitation; or\nBesides, according to section 185 of the Indian Contract Act, consideration is\nnot required to create an agency; or\nIn the case of gift actually made, no consideration is necessary. There need not\nbe nearness of relation and even if it is, there need not be any natural love an\naffection between them.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 224\nThe requirements in the above exceptions are noteworthy. The first one requires written and register ed\npromise. The second may be oral or in writing and the third must be in writing.\nFlaws in Contract\nThere may be circumstances under which a contract made under these rules may still be bad, because\nthere is a flaw, vice or error somewhere. As a result of such a flaw, the apparent agreement is not a real\nagreement. Where there is no real agreement, the law has three remedies:\nFirstly : The agreement may be treated as of no effect and it will then be known as void agreement.\nSecondly : The law may give the party aggrieved the option of getting out of his bargain, and the\ncontract is then known as voidable.\nThirdly : The party at fault may be compelled to pay damages to the other party\nVoid Agreement\nA void agreement is one which is destitute of all legal effects. It cannot be enforced and confers n o rights\non either party. It is really not a contract at all, it is non-existent. Technically the words \u2018void  contract\u2019 are\na contradiction in terms. But the expression provides a useful label for describing the situation th at arises\nwhen a \u2018contract\u2019 is claimed but in fact does not exist. For example, a minor\u2019s contract is void.\nAccording to Section 2 (j) of the Indian Contract Act, a contract which ceases to be enforceable by law\nbecomes void when it ceases to be enforceable. Void means a lack of existence or a nullity.\nContract Act, an agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more of the parties\nthereto, but not at the option of the other or others, is a voidable contract.\nA voidable contract is one which a party can put to an end. He can exercise his option, if his conse nt was\nnot free. The contract will, however be binding, if he does not exercise his option to avoid it with in a\nreasonable time. The consent of a party is not free and so he is entitled to avoid the contract, if he has\ngiven his consent due to misrepresentation, fraud, coercion or undue influence.\nIllegal Agreement\nAn illegal agreement is one which, like the void agreement has no legal effects as between the immed iate\nparties. Further, transactions collateral to it also become tainted with illegality and are, therefo re, not\nenforceable. Parties to an unlawful agreement cannot get any help from a Court of law, for no pollut ed\nhands shall touch the pure fountain of justice. On the other hand, a collateral transaction can be s upported\nby a void agreement.\nFor example, one party may have deceived the other party, or in some other way there may be no\ngenuine consent. The parties may be labouring under a mistake, or one or both the parties may be\nincapable of making a contract. Again, the agreement may be illegal or physically impossible. All th ese are\ncalled \u201cthe FLAWS in contract or the VICES of contract\u201d.\nThe chief flaws in contract are:\nFlaw in Capacity - Capacity and Persons\nIn law, persons are either natural or artificial. Natural persons are human beings and artificial pe rsons are\ncorporations. Contractual capacity or incapacity is an incident of personality.Incapacity Mistake Mis-\nrepresentationFraud\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 225\nThe general rule is that all natural persons have full capacity to make binding contracts. But the I ndian\nContract Act, 1872 admits an exception in the case of:\n(i)minors,\n(ii) lunatics, and\n(iii) persons disqualified from contracting by any law to which they are subject.\nExample: A & B entered into a contract in which A will steal a Diamond from a museum and B will give\nhim Rs. 5,00,000/- against its delivery. Is it a valid contract?\nNo, the consideration should not be illegal.\nThese persons are not competent to contract. Section 11of the Act provides that every \u201cperson is com petent\nto contract who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of  sound\nmind, and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject\u201d. A valid agreement\nrequires that both the parties should understand the legal implications of their conduct. Thus, both  must\nhave a mature mind. The legal yardstick to measure maturity according to the law of contract is, tha t both\nshould be major and of sound mind and if not, the law would presume that the maturity of their mind has\nnot reached to the extent of visualising the pros and cons of their acts, hence, a bar on minors and\nlunatics competency to contract.\nExample: S, a nurse is taking medical care of H, a seriously ill patient. They entered into a contra ct in\nwhich H transfers his Flat situated at Mumbai and S pays a consideration of Rs. 500/-. The actual ma rket\nvalue of the flat is 50 Lakh. Is this agreement voidable?\nYes, this contract has the element of undue influence. Therefore, it is voidable.\nLunatics Agreement\nA person of unsound mind is a lunatic. That is to say for the purposes of making contract, a person is of\nunsound mind if at the time when he makes the contract, he is incapable of understanding it and of\nforming rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests.\nA person of unsound mind cannot enter into a contract. A lunatic\u2019s agreement is therefore void. But if he\nmakes a contract when he is of sound mind, i.e., during lucid intervals, he will be bound by it.\nIf a contract entered into by a lunatic or person of unsound mind is for his benefit, it can be enfo rced (for\nthe benefit) against the other party but not vice-versa [ Jugal Kishore   v. Cheddu , (1903) l All. L.J 43]\nFlaw in Consent\nThe basis of a contract is agreement, i.e., mutual consent. In other words, the parties should mean the\nsomething in the same sense and agree voluntarily. It is when there is consent, that the parties are  said to\nbe consensus ad idem i.e. their minds have met. Not only consent is required but it must be a free c onsent.\nConsent is not free when it has been caused by coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, fraud o r\nmistake. These elements if present, may vitiate the contract.\nWhen this consent is wanting, the contract may turn out to be void or voidable according to the natu re\nof the flaw in consent. Where there is no consent, there can be no contract as in the case of mutual\nmistake. Where there is consent, but it is not free, a contract is generally voidable at the option of the party\nwhose consent is not free. In the case of misrepresentation, fraud, coercion, undue influence, the c onsent\nof one of the parties is induced or caused by the supposed existence of a fact which did not exist.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 226\nWilful Misrepresentation or Fraud\nAs per Section 7 of the Indian Contract Act, \u2018Fraud\u2019 means and includes any of the following acts co mmitted\nby a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another pa rty\nthereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:\n\u2014The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true;\n\u2014The active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact;\n\u2014A promise made without any intention of performing it;\n\u2014Any other act fitted to deceive;\n\u2014Any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent.\nFraud is an untrue statement made knowingly or without belief in its truth or recklessly, carelessly , whether\nit be true or false with the intent to deceive. The chief ingredients of a fraud are:\n(i)a false representation or assertion;\n(ii) of fact (and not a mere opinion),\n(iii) made with the intention that it should be acted upon,\n(iv) the representation must have actually induced the other party to enter into the contract and so\ndeceived him,\n(v) the party deceived must thereby be indemnified, for there is no fraud without damages, and\n(vi) the statement must have been made either with the knowledge that it was false or without belief\nin its truth or recklessly without caring whether it was true or false.\nIt is immaterial whether the representation takes effect by false statement or with concealment. The  party\ndefrauded can avoid the contract and also claim damages.\nMere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is no t fraud, unless\nsilence is in itself equivalent to speech, or where it is the duty of the person keeping silent to s peak as in the\ncases of contracts uberrimaefidei- (contracts requiring utmost good faith).\nContracts Uberrimae Fidei\nThere are contracts in which the law imposes a special duty to act with utmost good faith i.e., to d isclose\nall material information. Failure to disclose such information will render the contract voidable at the\noption of other party.\nContracts uberrimaefidei are:\n(a)Contract of insurance of all kinds : The assured must disclose to the insurer all material facts and\nwhatever he states must be correct and truthful.\n(b)Company prospectus  : When a company invites the public to subscribe for its shares, it is under\nstatutory obligation to disclose truthfully the various matters set out in the Companies Act. Any\nperson responsible for non-disclosure of any of these matters is liable to damages. Also, the\ncontract to buy shares is voidable where there is a material false statement or non- disclosure in\nthe prospectus.\n(c)Contract for the sale of land : The vendor is under a duty to the purchaser to show good title to the\nland he has contracted to sell.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 227\n(d)Contracts of family arrangements : When the members of a family make agreements or arrangements\nfor the settlement of family property, each member of the family must make full disclosure of every\nmaterial fact within his knowledge.\nCoercion\nCoercion as defined in Section 15 of the Act  means \u201cthe committing or threatening to commit any act\nforbidden by the Indian Penal Code, or unlawful detaining or threatening to detain, any property to the\nprejudice of any person whatever with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement \u201d.\nSimply stated, the doing of any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code is coercion even though such an\nact is done in a place where the Indian Penal Code is not in force. If A at the point of a pistol as ks B to\nexecute a promissory note in his favour and B to save his life does so he can avoid this agreement a s his\nconsent was not free. Even a threat to third-party, e.g., where A compels B to sign a document threa tening\nto harm C, in case B does not sign would also amount to coercion.\nIt has been held that mere threat by one person to another to prosecute him does not amount to\ncoercion. There must be a contract made under the threat and that contract should be one sought to b e\navoided because of coercion ( Ramchandra  v. Bank of Kohlapur , 1952 Bom. 715). It may be pointed out that\ncoercion may proceed from any person and may be directed against any person, even a stranger and als o\nagainst goods, e.g., by unlawful detention of goods.\nUndue Influence\nUnder Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is said to be produced by undue influe nce\n\u201cwhere the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a positio n to\ndominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other\u201d.\nThe elements of undue influence are:\n(i)A dominant position, and\n(ii)The use of it to obtain an unfair advantage.\nThe words \u201cunfair advantage\u201d do not limit the jurisdiction to cases where the transaction would be\nobviously unfair as between persons dealing on an equal footing. In the words of Lord Kingston, \u201cthe\nprinciple applies to every case where influence is acquired and abused where confidence is reposed a nd\nbetrayed\u201d.\nLegality of Object\nOne of the requisites of a valid contract is that the object should be lawful. Section 10 of the Ind ian\nContract Act, 1872, provides, \u201cAll agreements are contracts if they are made by free consent of part ies\ncompetent to contract for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object...\u201d Therefore, it follows that\nwhere the consideration or object for which an agreement is made is unlawful, it is not a contract.\nSection 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides that the consideration or object of an agreemen t is\nlawful unless it is\n(i)forbidden by law; or\n(ii) it is of such nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of law; or\n(iii) is fraudulent; or\n(iv) involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or\n(v) the Court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 228\nIn each of these cases the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agr eement\nof which the object or consideration is unlawful is void.\nVoid and Illegal Contracts\nA void contract is one which is destitute of legal effects altogether. An illegal contract too has n o legal\neffect as between the immediate parties to the contract, but has the further effect of tainting the collateral\ncontracts also with illegality. For instance A borrows from B,  Rs. 1,000 for lending to C a minor. The\ncontract between A and C is void, but B can nevertheless recover the money from A, On the other hand ,\nif A had borrowed Rs. 1,000 from B to buy a pistol to shoot C, the question whether B can recover th e\nmoney hinges on whether B was aware of the purpose for which money was borrowed. If B had knowledge\nof the illegal purpose, he cannot recover. Therefore, it may be said that all illegal agreements are  void but\nall void agreements are not necessarily illegal.\nConsequence of Illegal Agreements\n(i)an illegal agreement is entirely void;\n(ii) no action can be brought by a party to an illegal agreement. The maxim is \u201cEx turpi cause non-\noritur action\u201d - from an evil cause, no action arises;\n(iii) money paid or property transferred under an illegal agreement cannot be recovered. The maxim\nis in parti delicto potierest condition defendeties- In cases of equal guilt, more powerful is the\ncondition of the defendant;\n(iv) where an agreement consist of two parts, one part legal and other illegal, and the legal parts is\nseparable from the illegal one, then the Court will enforce the legal one. If the legal and the ille gal\nparts cannot be separated the whole agreement is illegal; and\n(v) any agreement which is collateral to an illegal agreement is also tainted with illegality and is\ntreated as being illegal, even though it would have been lawful by itself [ Firm Pratapchand v. Firm\nKotri Re. AIR (1975) S.C. 1223].\nAgreements Void as being opposed to Public Policy\nThe head public policy covers a wide range of topics. Agreements may offend public policy by tending  to\nprejudice of the State in times of war, by tending to abuse of justice or by trying to impose unreas onable\nand inconvenient restrictions on the free choice of individuals in marriage, or their liberty to exe rcise\nlawful trade or calling.\nThe doctrine of public policy is a branch of Common Law and like any other branch of Common Law it i s\ngoverned by the precedents [ Gherulal Parakh  v. MahadeodasMaiya  (1959) 2 S.C.R. (Suppl.) 406; AIR 1959\nS.C. 781]. The doctrine of public policy is not to be extended beyond the classes of cases already c overed\nby it and no Court can invent a new head of public policy [ Lord Halsbury , Janson  v. Driefontien Consolidated\nMines  (1902) A.C. 484, 491]. It has been said by the House of Lords that public policy is always an unsaf e\nand treacherous ground for legal decisions. Even if it is possible for Courts to evolve a new head o f public\npolicy, it should be done under extraordinary circumstances giving rise to incontestable harm to the\nsociety.\nThe following agreements are void as being against public policy but they are not illegal:\n(a)Agreement in restrain of parental rights : An agreement by which a party deprives himself of the\ncustody of his child is void.\n(b)Agreement in restraint of marriage : An agreement not to marry at all or not to marry any particular\nperson or class of persons is void as it is in restraint of marriage.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 229\n(c)Marriage brokerage or brokerage Agreements : An agreement to procure marriage for reward is\nvoid. Where a purohit (priest) was promised Rs.200 in consideration of procuring a wife for the\ndefendant, the promise was held void as opposed to public policy, and the purohit could not\nrecover the promised sum.\n(d)Agreements in restraint of personal freedom are void : Where a man agreed with his money lender\nnot to change his residence, or his employment or to part with any of his property or to incur any\nobligation on credit without the consent of the money lender, it was held that the agreement was\nvoid.\n(e)Agreement in restraint of trade  : An agreement in restraint of trade is one which seeks to restrict a\nperson from freely exercising his trade or profession.\nWagering Agreements\nThe literal meaning of the word \u201cwager\u201d is a \u201cbet\u201d. Wagering agreements are nothing but ordinary bet ting\nagreements. For example, A and B enter into an agreement that if England\u2019s Cricket Team wins the tes t\nmatch, A will pay B Rs.100 and if it loses B will pay Rs.100 to A. This is a wagering agreement and nothing\ncan be recovered by winning party under the agreement.\nThe essence of gaming and wagering is that one party is to win and the other to lose upon a future e vent\nwhich at the time of the contract is of an uncertain nature that is to say, if the event turns out o ne way A\nwill lose; but if it turns out the other way he will win (Thacker v. Hardy, (1878) 4 OBD 685).\nWagering Agreements V oid\nIn India except Mumbai, wagering agreements are void. In Mumbai, wagering agreements have been\ndeclared illegal by the Avoiding Wagers (Amendment) Act, 1865. Therefore, in Mumbai a wagering\nagreement being illegal, is void not only between the immediate parties, but taints and renders void  all\ncollateral agreements to it.\nThus, A bets with B and losses, applies to C for a loan, who pays B in settlement of A\u2019s losses. C c annot\nrecover from A because this is money paid \u201cunder\u201d or \u201cin respect of\u201d a wagering transaction which is\nillegal in Mumbai. But in respect of India such a transaction (i.e., betting) being only void, C cou ld recover\nfrom A. Of course, if A refused to pay B the amount of the bet that he has lost, B could not sue A a nywhere.\nAgain, where an agent bets on behalf of his principal and loses and pays over the money to the winne r, he\ncannot recover the money from his principal, if the transactions took place in Mumbai, but elsewhere  he\ncould recover. But if the agent wins, he must pay the winnings to the principal, as this money was r eceived\non behalf of the principal.\nSometimes, commercial transactions assume the form of wagering contracts. The sample test to find ou t\nwhether a particular transaction is a wager or a genuine commercial transaction is: \u201cWhere delivery of\nthe goods sold is intended to be given and taken, it is valid contract, but where only the differenc es are\nintended to be paid, it will be a wagering contract and unenforceable\u201d.\nIn a wagering contract there must be mutuality in the sense that the gain of one party should be los s to the\nother on the happening of an uncertain event which is the subject matter of the contract.\nV oid Agreements\nThe following types of agreements are void under Indian Contract Act:\n(a)Agreement by or with a minor or a person of unsound mind or a person disqualified to enter into\na contract - Section 11;\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 230\n(b)Agreement made under a mistake of fact, material to the agreement on the part of the both the\nparties - Section 20.\n(c)An agreement of which the consideration or object is unlawful - Section 23.\n(d)If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of\nseveral considerations for a single object, is unlawful, the agreement is void - Section 24.\n(e)An agreement made without consideration subject to three exceptions provided to Section 25.\n(f)An agreement in restraint of marriage - Section 26.\n(g)An agreement in restraint of trade - Section 27.\n(h)An agreement in restraint of legal proceedings - Section 28.\n(i)Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable of being made certain - Section 29.\n(j)Agreement by way of wager- Section 30.\n(k)An agreement to enter into an agreement in the future.\n(l)An agreement to do an act impossible in itself - Section 56(1)\nWhen Contract becomes Void\n\u2014An agreement not enforceable by law is void ab initio - Section 2(g).\n\u2014A contract which ceases to be enforceable by law becomes void when it ceases to be enforceable\n- Section 2(j)\n\u2014A contract becomes void when, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent,\nthe performance of the contract becomes impossible, e.g., by destruction of the subject- matter of\nthe contract after the formation of the contract.\n\u2014A contract becomes void by reason of subsequent illegality. A in India agrees to supply goods to\nB in Pakistan. After the formation of the contract war breaks out between India and Pakistan and\nthe supply of goods to Pakistan is prohibited by legislation. The contract becomes void.\n\u2014A contingent contract to do or not do to anything if an uncertain future event happens becomes\nvoid if the event becomes impossible.\n\u2014Where a contract is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party, the contract becomes void\nwhen the option is exercised by him.\nContingent Contract\nAs per Section 31, a contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event\ncollateral to such contract, does or does not happen. For example, A contracts to sell B 10 bales of  cotton\nfor Rs. 20,000, if the ship by which they are coming returns safely. This is a contingent contract. Contract\nof insurance and contracts of indemnity and guarantee are popular instances of contingent contracts.\nQuasi-Contracts\nA valid contract must contain certain essential elements, such as offer and acceptance, capacity to\ncontract, consideration and free consent. But sometimes the law implies a promise imposing obligatio ns\non one party and conferring right in favour of the other even when there is no offer, no acceptance,  no\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 231\nconsensus ad idem, and in fact, there is neither agreement nor promise. Such cases are not contracts  in\nthe strict sense, but the Court recognises them as relations resembling those of contracts and enfor ces\nthem as if they were contracts, hence the term quasi- contracts (i.e., resembling a contract).\nA quasi-contract rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himse lf\nunjustly at the expense of another. In truth, it is not a contract at all. It is an obligation which  the law\ncreates, in the absence of any agreement, when any person is in the possession of other person\u2019s mon ey,\nor its equivalent, under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retai n it,\nand which in justice and fairness belongs to another. It is the duty and not an agreement or intenti on\nwhich defines it. A very simple illustration is money paid under mistake. Equity demands that such m oney\nmust be paid back.\nDischarge or T ermination of Contracts\nA contract is said to be discharged or terminated when the rights and obligations arising out of a c ontract\nare extinguished. Contracts may be discharged or terminated by any of the following modes:\nPerformance of Contracts\nMutual consent or agreement\nLapse of time\nOperation of law\nImpossibility of performance\nBreach of contract\nDischarge by Impossibility or Frustration\nIn India, the doctrine of frustration is primarily looked at as contained in Sections 32 and 56 of t he Act. The\nCourt usually gives relief on the ground of subsequent impossibility when it finds that the whole pu rpose\nor the basis of the contract was frustrated by the intrusion or occurrence of an event that was not\ncontemplated by the parties. The Court also grants relief where one of the parties was or could have  been\naware of such a contingency happening and the other party was not. Before invoking the doctrine, it\nmust be shown that the event, which has produced the frustration was one which the parties to the\ncontract did not foresee and could not with reasonable diligence have foreseen.\nA contract which is entered into to perform something that is clearly impossible is void. For instan ce, A\nagrees with B to discover treasure by magic. The agreement is void by virtue of Section 56 para 1 wh ich\nlays down the principle that an agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void.\nSometimes subsequent impossibility (i.e. where the impossibility supervenes after the contract has b een\nmade) renders the performance of a contract unlawful and stands discharged; as for example, where a\nsinger contracts to sing and becomes too ill to do so, the contract becomes void. In this connection , para\n2 of Section 56 provides that a contract to do an act, which after the contract is made, becomes imp ossible\nor by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act\nbecomes impossible or unlawful.\nIf the impossibility is not obvious and the promisor alone knows of the impossibility or illegally t hen existing\nor the promisor might have known as such after using reasonable diligence, such promisor is bound to\ncompensate the promisee for any loss he may suffer through the non-performance of the promise in spi te\nof the agreement being void ab-initio (Section 56, para 3).\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 232\nIn Satyabarta Ghose  v . Mugnuram A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 44 the Supreme Court interpreted the term \u2018impossible\nappearing in second paragraph of Section 56. The Court observed that the word \u2018impossible has not be en\nused here in the sense of physical or literal impossibility. The performance of an act may not be li terally\nimpossible but it may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose which\nthe parties had in view; and if an untoward event or change of circumstances totally upsets the very\nfoundation upon which the parties rested their bargain; it can very well be said that the promisor f ound it\nimpossible to do the act which he promised to do. In this case, A undertook to sell a plot of land t o B but\nbefore the plot could be developed, war broke out and the land was temporarily requisitioned by the\nGovernment. A offered to return earnest money to B in cancellation of contract. B did not accept and\nsued A for specific performance. A pleaded discharge by frustration. The Court held that Section 56 is not\napplicable on the ground that the requisition was of temporary nature and there was no time limit wi thin\nwhich A was obliged to perform the contract. The impossibility was not of such a nature which would\nstrike at the root of the contract.\nBreach of Contract\nWhere the promisor neither performs his contract nor does he tender performance, or where the\nperformance is defective, there is a breach of contract. The breach of contract may be (i) actual; o r (ii)\nanticipatory. The actual breach may take place either at the time the performance is due, or when ac tually\nperforming the contract. Anticipatory breach means a breach before the time for the performance has\narrived. This may also take place in two ways \u2013 by the promisor doing an act which makes the perform ance\nof his promise impossible or by the promisor in some other way showing his intention not to perform it.\nBreach of contract may occur, before the time for performance is due. This may happen where one of t he\nparties definitely renounces the contract and shows his intention not to perform it or does some act\nwhich makes performance impossible. The other party, on such a breach being committed, has a right o f\naction for damages.\nHe may either sue for breach of contract immediately after repudiation or wait till the actual date when\nperformance is due and then sue for breach. If the promisee adopts the latter course, i.e., waits ti ll the date\nwhen performance is due, he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the promisor as well as for his own.\nHe remains liable under it and enables the promisor not only to complete the contract in spite of pr evious\nrepudiation, but also to avail himself of any excuse for non- performance which may have come into\nexistence before the time fixed for performance.\nIn Hochester  v. De La Tour  (1853) E.R. 922, A hired B in April to act as a courier commencing employment\nfrom 1st June, but wrote to B in May repudiating the agreement, B sued A for breach of contract imme diately\nafter repudiation. A contended that there could not be breach of contract before June 1. Held, B was\nimmediately entitled to sue and need not wait till 1st June, for his right of action to accrue.\nIn Avery  v . Bowden  (1856) 116 E.R. 1122, A hired B\u2019s ship to carry a cargo from Russia. Later on B repudiated\nthe contract. A delayed taking action hoping B would change his mind before the performance date. Wa r\nbroke out between Russia and Britain before the performance date frustrating the contract. Held, A l ost\nhis right to sue B for damages by his delay.\nIn Frost  v. Knight  (1872) L.R. 7 Ex. 111, the law on the subject of anticipatory breach was summed up as\nfollows:\n\u201cThe promisee if he pleases may treat the notice of intention as inoperative and await the time when  the\ncontract is to be executed and then hold the other party responsible for all the consequences of non -\nperformance: but in that case he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the other party as well  as his\nown; he remains subject to all his own obligations and liabilities under it, and enables the other p arty not\nonly to complete the contract, if so advised, notwithstanding his previous repudiation of it, but al so to take\nadvantage of any supervening circumstances which would justify him in declining to complete it.\u201d\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 233\nRemedies for Breach of Contract\nWhere a contract is broken, the injured party has several courses of action open to him. The appropr iate\nremedy in any case will depend upon the subject-matter of the contract and the nature of the breach.\nWhen a party to a contract has broken the contract, the other party may treat the contract as rescin ded\nand he is absolved from all his obligations under the contract. Under Section 65, when a party treat s the\ncontract as rescinded, he makes himself liable to restore any benefits he has received under the con tract\nto the party from whom such benefits were received. Under Section 75 of the Indian Contract Act, if a\nperson rightfully rescinds a contract, he is entitled to a compensation for any damage which he has\nsustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract by the other party. Section 64 deals with conse quences\nof rescission of voidable contracts, i.e., where there is flaw in the consent of one party to the co ntract.\nUnder this Section when a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds, the other party th ereto\nneed not perform any promise therein contained in which he is the promisor. The party rescinding a\nvoidable contract shall, if he has received any benefit thereunder, from another party to such contr act,\nrestore such benefit so far as may be, to the person from whom it was received.\nContract of Indemnity and Guarantee\nA contract of indemnity is a contract by which one party promises to save the other party from loss caused\nto him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person (Section 124). For\nexample, A contracts to indemnify B against the consequence of any proceedings which C may take\nagainst B in respect of a certain sum of 300 rupees. This is a contract of indemnity. The contract o f\nindemnity may be express or implied. The later may be inferred from the circumstances of a particula r\ncase, e.g., an act done by A at the request of B. If A incurs any expenses, he can recover the same from B.\nThe person who promises to indemnify or make good the loss is called the indemnifier and the person\nwhose loss is made good is called the indemnified or the indemnity holder. A contract of insurance i s an\nexample of a contract of indemnity according to English Law. In consideration of premium, the insure r\npromises to make good the loss suffered by the assured on account of the destruction by fire of his\nproperty insured against fire.\nUnder the Indian Contract Act, the contract of indemnity is restricted to such cases only where the loss\npromised to be reimbursed, is caused by the conduct of the promisor or of any other person.

The person who gives the guarantee is called the Surety, the person for whom th e\nguarantee is given is called the Principal Debtor, and the person to whom the guarantee is given is called\nthe Creditor (Section 126). A guarantee may be either oral or written, although in the English law , it must\nbe in writing.\nIllustration\nA advances a loan of Rs.5, 000 to B and C promises to A that if B does not repay the loan, C will do  so. This\nis a contract of guarantee. Here B is the principal debtor, A is the creditor and C is the surety or  guarantor.\nLike a contract of indemnity, a guarantee must also satisfy all the essential elements of a valid co ntract.\nThere is, however, a special feature with regard to consideration in a contract of guarantee. The\nconsideration received by the principal debtor is sufficient for surety. Section 127 provides that a nything\ndone or any promise made for the benefit of the principal debtor may be a sufficient consideration t o the\nsurety for giving the guarantee.\nDistinction between Contract of Indemnity and Contract of Guarantee\nContract of Indemnity Contract of Guarantee\nIn  a contract of indemnity there are only two In   a   contract   of   guarantee,    there   are  three\nparties: the indemnifier and the indemnified. parties;  the  surety,  the  principal  debtor  and  the\ncreditor.\nIn  a contract  of  indemnity, the liability of the In   a   contract  of  guarantee,  the  liability  of  the\nindemnifier is primary. surety is secondary.

As\nthe definition indicates, an agent is a mere connecting link between the principal and a third-party . But\nduring the period that an agent is acting for his principal, he is clothed with the capacity of his principal.\nA contract of agency may be express or implied, (Section 186) but consideration is not an essential\nelement in this contract (Section 185). Agency may also arise by estoppel, necessity or ratification .\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 235\n(a)Express Agency  : A contract of agency may be made orally or in writing. The usual form of written\ncontract of agency is the Power of Attorney, which gives him the authority to act on behalf of his\nprincipal in accordance with the terms and conditions therein. In an agency created to transfer\nimmovable property, the power of attorney must be registered. A power of attorney may be\ngeneral, giving several powers to the agent, or special, giving authority to the agent for transacti ng\na single act.\n(b)Implied Agency : Implied agency may arise by conduct, situation of parties or necessity of the case.\n(i)Agency by Estoppel (Section 237) : Estoppel arises when you are precluded from denying the\ntruth of anything which you have represented as a fact, although it is not a fact. Thus, where\nP allows third-parties to believe that A is acting as his authorised agent, he will be estopped\nfrom denying the agency if such third-parties relying on it make a contract with A even when\nA had no authority at all.\n(ii) Wife as agent : Where a husband and wife are living together, the wife is presumed to have her\nhusband\u2019s authority to pledge his credit for the purchase of necessaries of life suitable to their\nstandard of living. But the husband will not be liable if he shows that (i) he had expressly\nwarned the tradesman not to supply goods on credit to his wife; or (ii) he had expressly\nforbidden the wife to pledge his credit; or (iii) his wife was already sufficiently supplied with\nthe articles in question; or (iv) she was supplied with a sufficient allowance.\nSimilarly, where any person is held out by another as his agent, the third-party can hold that\nperson liable for the acts of the ostensible agent, or the agent by holding out. Partners are\neach other\u2019s agents for making contracts in the ordinary course of the partnership business.\n(iii) Agency of Necessity (Sections 188 and 189) : In certain circumstances, a person who has been\nentrusted with another\u2019s property, may have to incur unauthorised expenses to protect or\npreserve it. Such an agency is called an agency of necessity. For example, A sent a horse by\nrailway and on its arrival at the destination there was no one to receive it. The railway\ncompany, being bound to take reasonable steps to keep the horse alive, was an agent of\nnecessity of A.\nA wife deserted by her husband and thus forced to live separate from him, can pledge her\nhusband\u2019s credit to buy all necessaries of life according to the position of the husband even\nagainst his wishes.\n(iv) Agency by ratification (Sections 169-200) : Where a person having no authority purports to act\nas agent, or a duly appointed agent exceeds his authority, the principal is not bound by the\ncontract supposedly based on his behalf. But the principal may ratify the agent\u2019s transaction\nand so accept liability. In this way an agency by ratification arises. This is also known as ex post\nfacto agency\u2014 agency arising after the event. The effect of ratification is to render the contract\nbinding on the principal as if the agent had been authorised beforehand. Also ratification\nrelates back to the original making of the contract so that the agency is taken to have come\ninto existence from the moment the agent first acted, and not from the date the principal\nratified it. Ratification is effective only if the following conditions are satisfied-\n(a)The agent must expressly contract as agent for a principal who is in existence and\ncompetent to contract.\n(b)The principal must be competent to contract not only at the time the agent acted, but\nalso when he ratified the agents act.\n(c)The principal at the time of ratification has full knowledge of the material facts, and must\nratify the whole contract, within a reasonable time.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 236\n(d)Ratification cannot be made so as to subject a third-party to damages, or terminate any\nright or interest of a third person.\n(e)Only lawful acts can be ratified.\nClasses of Agents\nAgents may be special or general or, they may be mercantile agents:\n(a)Special Agent : A special agent is one who is appointed to do a specified act, or to perform a\nspecified function. He has no authority outside this special task. The third-party has no right to\nassume that the agent has unlimited authority. Any act of the agent beyond that authority will not\nbind the principal.\n(b)General Agent : A general agent is appointed to do anything within the authority given to him by\nthe principal in all transactions, or in all transactions relating to a specified trade or matter. T he\nthird- party may assume that such an agent has power to do all that is usual for a general agent to\ndo in the business involved. The third party is not affected by any private restrictions on the\nagent\u2019s authority.\nSub-Agent\nA person who is appointed by the agent and to whom the principal\u2019s work is delegated to known as sub -\nagent. Section 191 provides that \u201ca sub-agent is a person employed by, and acting under the control of the\noriginal agent in the business of the agency.\u201d So, the sub-agent is the agent of the original agent.\nAs between themselves, the relation of sub-agent and original agent is that of agent and the princip al. A\nsub- agent is bound by all the duties of the original agent. The sub-agent is not directly responsib le to the\nprincipal except for fraud and wilful wrong. The sub-agent is responsible to the original agent. The  original\nagent is responsible to the principal for the acts of the sub-agent. As regards third persons, the p rincipal is\nrepresented by sub-agent and he is bound and responsible for all the acts of sub-agent as if he were  an\nagent originally appointed by the principal.\nMercantile Agents\nSection 2(9) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, defines a mercantile agent as \u201ca mercantile agent havin g in\nthe customary course of business as such agent authority either to sell goods or consign goods for t he\npurposes of sale, or to buy goods, or to raise money on the security of goods\u201d. This definition cove rs\nfactors, brokers, auctioneers, commission agents etc.\nFactors\nA factor is a mercantile agent employed to sell goods which have been placed in his possession or\ncontract to buy goods for his principal. He is the apparent owner of the goods in his custody and ca n sell\nthem in his own name and receive payment for goods. He has an insurable interest in goods and also a\ngeneral lien in respect of any claim he may have arising out of the agency.\nBrokers\nA broker is a mercantile agent whose ordinary course of business is to make contracts with other par ties\nfor the sale and purchase of goods and securities of which he is not entrusted with the possession f or a\ncommission called brokerage. He acts in the name of principal. He has no lien over the goods as he i s not\nin possession of them.\nDel Credere Agent\nA del credere agent is a mercantile agent, who is in consideration of an extra remuneration guarante es\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 237\nto his principal that the purchasers who buy on credit will pay for the goods they take. In the even t of a\nthird-party failing to pay, the del credere agent is bound to pay his principal the sum owned by thi rd-party.\nAuctioneers\nAn auctioneer is an agent who sells goods by auction, i.e., to the highest bidder in public competit ion. He\nhas no authority to warrant his principal\u2019s title to the goods. He is an agent for the seller but af ter the goods\nhave been knocked down he is agent for the buyer also for the purpose of evidence that the sale has taken\nplace.\nPartners\nIn a partnership firm, every partner is an agent of the firm and of his co-partners for the purpose of the\nbusiness of the firm.\nBankers\nThe relationship between a banker and his customer is primarily that of debtor and creditor. In addi tion,\na banker is an agent of his customer when he buys or sells securities, collects cheques, dividends, bills or\npromissory notes on behalf of his customer. He has a general lien on all securities and goods in his\npossession in respect of the general balance due to him by the customer.\nDuties of the Agent\nAn agent\u2019s duties towards his principal are as follows (which give corresponding rights to the princ ipal\nwho may sue for damages in the event of a breach of duty by the agent):\n(a)An agent must act within the scope of the authority conferred upon him and carry out strictly the\ninstructions of the principal (Section 211).\n(b)In the absence of express instructions, he must follow the custom prevailing in the same kind of\nbusiness at the place where the agent conducts the business (Section 211).\n(c)He must do the work with reasonable skill and diligence whereby the nature of his profession, the\nagent purports to have special skill, he must exercise the skill which is expected from the members\nof the profession (Section 212).\n(d)He must disclose promptly any material information coming to his knowledge which is likely to\ninfluence the principal in the making of the contract.\n(e)He must not disclose confidential information entrusted to him by his principal (Section 213).\n(f)He must not allow his interest to conflict with his duty, e.g., he must not compete with his princip al\n(Section 215).\n(g)The agent must keep true accounts and must be prepared on reasonable notice to render an\naccount.\n(h)He must not make any secret profit; he must disclose any extra profit that he may make.\nWhere an agent is discovered taking secret bribe, etc., the principal is entitled to (i) dismiss the\nagent without notice, (ii) recover the amount of secret profit, and (iii) refuse to pay the agent hi s\nremuneration.\nHe may repudiate the contract, if the third-party is involved in secret profit and also recover\ndamages.\n(i)An agent must not delegate his authority to sub-agent. A sub-agent is a person employed by and\nacting under the control of the original agent in the business of agency (Section 191). This rule is\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 238\nbased on the principle: Delegatus non-potest delegare \u2014 a delegate cannot further delegate\n(Section 190).\nBut there are exceptions to this rule and the agent may delegate (i) where delegation is allowed\nby the principal, (ii) where the trade custom or usage sanctions delegation, (iii) where delegation\nis essential for proper performance, (iv) where an emergency renders it imperative, (v) where\nnature of the work is purely ministerial, and (vi) where the principal knows that the agent intends\nto delegate.\nRights of Agents\nWhere the services rendered by the agent are not gratuitous or voluntary, the agent is entitled to receive\nthe agreed remuneration, or if none was agreed, a reasonable remuneration. The agent becomes entitle d\nto receive remuneration as soon as he has done what he had undertaken to do (Section 219).\nCertain classes of agents, e.g., factors who have goods and property of their principal in their pos session,\nhave a lien on the goods or property in respect of their remuneration and expense and liabilities in curred.\nHe has a right to stop the goods in transit where he is an unpaid seller.\nAs the agent represents the principal, the agent has a right to be indemnified by the principal agai nst all charges,\nexpenses and liabilities properly incurred by him in the course of the agency (Sections 222-223).\nThe extent of the authority of an agent depends upon the terms expressed in his appointment or it ma y be\nimplied by the circumstances of the case. The contractual authority is the real authority, but impli ed authority\nis to do whatever is incidental to carry out the real authority. This implied authority is also know n as apparent\nor ostensible authority. Thus, an agent having an authority to do an act has authority to do everyth ing lawful\nwhich is necessary for the purpose or usually done in the course of conducting business.\nAn agent has authority to do all such things which may be necessary to protect the principal from lo ss in\nan emergency and which he would do to protect his own property under similar circumstances. Where\nbutter was becoming useless owing to delay in transit and was therefore sold by the station master f or the\nbest price available as it was not possible to obtain instructions from the principal, the sale was held\nbinding upon the principal.\nTERMINATION OF AGENCY\n\uf09fBy the performance of the contract of agency; (Section 201)\n\uf09fBy an agreement between the principal and the agent;\n\uf09fBy expiration of the period fixed for the contract of agency;\n\uf09fBy the death of the principal or the agency; (Section 201)\n\uf09fBy the insanity of either the principal or the agent; (Section 201)\n\uf09fBy the insolvency of the principal, and in some cases that of the agent; (Section 201)\n\uf09fWhere the principal or agent is an incorporated company, by its dissolution;\n\uf09fBy the destruction of the subject-matter; (Section 56)\n\uf09fBy the renunciation of his authority by the agent; (Section 201)\n\uf09fBy the revocation of authority by the principal.

In the electronic age, the whole transaction can be completed in seconds ,\nwith both parties simply affixing their digital signatures to an electronic copy of the contract.

LAW RELATING TO TORTS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe word \u2018tort\u2019 is a French equivalent of English word \u2018wrong\u2019. The word tort is derived from Latin word\nTortum. Thus, simply stated \u2018tort\u2019 means wrong. But every wrong or wrongful act is not a tort. Tort is really\na kind of civil wrong as opposed to criminal wrong. Wrongs, in law, are either public or private.\nBroadly speaking, public wrongs are the violations of \u2018public law and hence amount to be offences ag ainst\nthe State, while private wrongs are the breaches of private law, i.e., wrongs against individuals. P ublic\nwrongs or crimes are those wrongs which are made punishable under the penal law belonging to the\npublic law group.\n\"Tort\" means a civil wrong which is not exclusively the breach of a contract or the breach of trust.  The\ndistinction between civil and criminal wrongs depends on the nature of the appropriate remedy provid ed\nby law .\nSection 2(m) of the Limitation Act, 1963, states: \u201cTort means a civil wrong which is not exclusively  a breach\nof contract or breach of trust.\u201d\nSalmond  defines it as \u201da civil wrong for which the remedy is a common law action for unliquidated\ndamages and which is not exclusively the breach of a contract or the breach of a trust or other mere ly\nequitable obligation.\u201d\nFraser describes it as \u201can infringement of a right in rem of a private individual giving a right of compens ation\nat the suit of the injured party.\u201d\nWinfield  says: \u201cTortious liability arises from the breach of duty, primarily fixed by law; this duty is towa rds\npersons generally and its breach is redressable by an action for unliquidated damages\u201d.\nTwo important elements can be derived from l these definitions, namely: (i) that a tort is a species  of civil\ninjury of wrong as opposed to a criminal wrong, and (ii) that every civil wrong is not a tort. Accor dingly,\nit is possible to distinguish tort from a crime and from a contract, a trust and a quasi-contract. T he\ndistinction between civil and criminal wrongs depends on the nature of the appropriate remedy provid ed\nby law .\nGeneral Conditions of Liability for a Tort\nAs stated earlier, there is no fixed catalogue of circumstances, which along and for all-time mark t he limit\nof what are torts. Certain situations have been held to be torts and will continue to be so in the a bsence\nof statutory repeal, and others have been held not to be torts. However, certain general conditions for\ntortuous liability can be laid down.\nIn general, a tort consists of some act or omission by the defendant (tortfeasor) whereby he has wit hout\njust cause or excuse caused some harm to plaintiff. To constitute a tort, there must be:\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 241\n(i)Wrongful act : The act complained of, should under the circumstances, be legally wrongful as\nregards the party complaining. In other words, it should prejudicially affect any of the above\nmentioned interests, and protected by law. Thus, every person whose legal rights, e.g., right of\nreputation, right of bodily safety and freedom, and right to property are violated without legal\nexcuse, has a right of action against the person who violated them, whether loss results from such\nviolation or not.\n(ii)Legal damages : It is not every damage that is a damage in the eye of law. It must be a damage\nwhich the law recognizes as such. In other words, there should be legal injury or invasion of the\nlegal right. In the absence of an infringement of a legal right, an action does not lie. Also, where\nthere is infringement of a legal right, an action lies even though no damage may have been\ncaused. As was stated in Ashby v. White, (1703) 2 Ld. Raym. 938 legal damage is neither identical\nwith actual damage nor is it necessarily pecuniary. Two maxims, namely: (i) Damnum sine injuria,\nand (ii) injuria sine damnum, explain this proposition.\nDamnum Sine Injuria\nDamnum means harm, loss or damage in respect of money, comfort, health, etc. Injuria means\ninfringement of a right conferred by law on the plaintiff. The maxim means that in a given case, a\nman may have suffered damage and yet have no action in tort, because the damage is not to an\ninterest protected by the law of torts. Therefore, causing damage, however substantial to another\nperson is not actionable in law unless there is also a violation of a legal right of the plaintiff.\nCommon examples are, where the damage results from an act done in the exercise of legal rights.\nThus, if I own a shop and you open a shop in the neighbourhood, as a result of which I lose some\ncustomers and my profits fall off, I cannot sue you for the loss in profits, because you are exercis ing\nyour legal right. [ Gloucester Grammer School case , (1410) Y.B. Hill. 11 Hen, IV to 27, pp. 21, 36]\nExample: A has stored 100 Ltr of Spirit in a barrel and kept it at a place in which he is legally en titled to\nstore. B kept his goods on the barrel and left it overnight. All the goods were spoilt.\nIn this case, there is damage to B but there is no legal injury. Therefore, this is not actionable u nder Law\nof Torts.\nInjuria Sine Damnum\nIt means injury without damage, i.e., where there is no damage resulted yet it is an injury or wrong\nin tort, i.e. where there is infringement of a legal right not resulting in harm but plaintiff can s till sue\nin tort.\nSome rights or interests are so important that their violation is an actionable tort without proof o f\ndamage. Thus when there is an invasion of an \u201cabsolute\u201d private right of an individual, there is an\ninjuria and the plaintiff\u2019s action will succeed even if there is no Domnum or damages. An absolute\nright is one, the violation of which is actionable per se, i.e., without the proof of any damage.A wrongful act or omission of the defendant;\nThe wrongful act must result in causing legal damage to another; and\nThe wrongful act must be of such a nature as to give rise to legal remedy.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 242\nInjuria sine domno covers such cases and action lies when the right is violated even though no\ndamage has occurred. Thus, the act of trespassing upon another\u2019s land is actionable even though\nit has not caused the plaintiff even the slightest harm.\nExample: A casted his vote in the election. The returning officer cancelled his vote illegally. The\naction did not effect the election as the candidate voted by A has won by big majority. Can A sue th e\nreturning officer under Law of Torts.\nYes, there is Legal Injury in this case. Therefore, A can take action under Law of Torts.\n(iii)Legal remedy : The third condition of liability for a tort is legal remedy. This means that to constitute\na tort, the wrongful act must come under the law. The main remedy for a tort is an action for\nunliquidated damages, although some other remedies, e.g., injunction, may be obtained in addition\nto damages or specific restitution may be claimed in an action for the detention of a chattel. Self-\nhelp is a remedy of which the injured party can avail himself without going to a law court. It does\nnot apply to all torts and perhaps the best example of these to which it does apply is trespass to\nland. For example, if \u201cA\u201d finds a drunken stranger in his room who has no business to be there, and\nis thus a trespass, he (A) is entitled to get rid of him, if possible without force but if that be n ot\npossible with such force as the circumstances of the case may warrant.\nMens Rea\nHow far a guilty mind of persons is required for liability for tort?\nThe General principle lies in the maxim \u201cactus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea\u201d i.e. the act itself  creates no\nguilt in the absence of a guilty mind. It does not mean that for the law or Torts, the act must be d one with\nan evil motive, but simply means that mind must concur in the Act, the act must be done either with\nwrongful intention or negligence. However, the  cases of absolute or strict liability are exceptions  to this\nprinciple.\nObjective is to punish the accused if\nconvictedDifferences between TORT and\nCRIMETORT\nCRIMEInfringement of private or civil rights\nof individual\nObjective is to recompensate the\nplaintiff for the loss suffered by him\nBreach of public rights which\naffect the whole community\nDamages are fixed according to the\ncontractDifferences between TORT\nand BREACH OF CONTRACTTORT\nBREACH OF\nCONTRACTBreach of duty which is fixed by law\nDamages are generally unliquidated\nand are determined by the Court\nBreach of duty which is fixed by the\nContracting Parties\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 243\nKinds of T ortious Liability\nStrict or Absolute Liability Vicarious Liability Vicarious Liability of the State\nStrict or Absolute Liability\nIn some torts, the defendant is liable even though the harm to the plaintiff occurred without intent ion or\nnegligence on the part of defendant. In other words, the defendant is held liable without fault. The se\ncases fall under the following categories:\n(i)Liability for Inevitable Accident  \u2013 Such liability arises in cases where damage is done by the escape\nof dangerous substances brought or kept by anyone upon his land. Such cases are where a man\nis made by law an insurer of other against the result of his activities.\n(ii) Liability for Inevitable Mistake  \u2013 Such cases are where a person interferes with the property or\nreputation of another.\n(iii) Vicarious Liability for Wrongs committed by others  \u2013 Responsibility in such cases is imputed by law\non the  grounds of social policy or expediency. These case involve liability of master for the acts of\nhis servant.\nThe rule in Rylands  v. Flethcer (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330 is that a man acts at his peril and is the insurer of the\nsafety of his neighbour against accidental harm. Such duty is absolute because it is independent of\nnegligence on the part of the defendant or his servants. It was held in that case that: \u201cIf a person  brings or\naccumulates on his land anything which, if it should escape may cause damage to his neighbours, he\ndoes so at his own peril. If it does not escape and cause damage he is responsible, however careful he may\nhave been, and whatever precautions he may have taken to prevent damage.\u201d\nThe facts of this case were as follows: B, a mill owner employed independent contractors, who were\napparently competent to construct a reservoir on his land to provide water for his mill. There were old\ndisused mining shafts under the site of the reservoir which the contractors failed to observe becaus e they\nwere filled with earth. The contractors therefore, did not block them. When the water was filled in the\nreservoir, it bursts through the shafts and flooded the plaintiff\u2019s coal mines on the adjoining land . It was\nfound as a fact that B did not know of the shafts and had not been negligent, though the independent\ncontractors, had been, B was held liable. Blackburn, J., observed; \u201cW e think that the true rule of l aw is that\nthe person, who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likel y to\ndo mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril and if, he does not do so is, prima facie answe rable for all\nthe damage which is the natural consequence of its escape.\u201d\nLater in the case of Read v. Lyons  [(1946) 2 All. E.R. 471 (H.L.)], it has been explained that two conditions\nare necessary in order to apply the rule in Ryland v. Fletcher, these are:\n\u2014Escape from a place of which the defendant has occupation or over which he has a control to a\nplace which is outside his occupation or control or something likely to do mischief if it escapes;\nand\n\u2014Non-natural use of Land : The defendant is liable if he makes a non-natural use of land. If either o f\nthese conditions is absent, the rule of strict liability will not apply.\nExceptions to the Rule of Strict Liability\nThe following exceptions to the rule of strict liability have been introduced in course of time, som e of them\nbeing inherent in the judgment itself in Ryland  v. Fletcher:\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 244\n(i)Damage due to Natural Use of the Land\nIn Ryland  v. Fletcher  water collected in the reservoir in such large quantity, was held to be non-\nnatural use of land. Keeping water for ordinary domestic purpose is \u2018natural use\u2019. Things not\nessentially dangerous which is not unusual for a person to have on his own land, such as water\npipe installations in buildings, the working of mines and minerals on land, the lighting of fire in a\nfire-place of a house, and necessary wiring for supplying electric light, fall under the category of\n\u201cnatural use\u201d of land.\n(ii) Consent of the plaintiff\nWhere the plaintiff has consented to the accumulation of dangerous thing on the defendant\u2019s\nland, the liability under the rule in Ryland  v. Flethcher  does not arise. Such a consent is implied\nwhere the source of danger is for the \u2018common benefit\u2019 of both the plaintiff and the defendant.\n(iii) Act of Third Party\nIf the harm has been caused due to the act of a stranger, who is neither defendant\u2019s servant nor\nagent nor the defendant has any control over him, the defendant will not be liable. Thus, in Box\nv. Jubh  (1879) 4 Ex. D. 76, the overflow from the defendant\u2019s reservoir was caused by blocking of\na drain by stranger, the defendant was held not liable. But if the act of the stranger, is or can be\nforeseen by the defendant and the damage can be prevented, the defendant must, by due care\nprevent the damage. Failure on his part to avoid such damage will make him liable.\n(iv) Statutory Authority\nSometimes, public bodies storing water, gas, electricity and the like are by statute, exempted from\nliability so long as they have taken reasonable care.\nThus, in Green  v. Chelzea Water Works Co.  (1894) 70 L.T. 547 the defendant company had a\nstatutory duty to maintain continuous supply of water. A main belonging to the company burst\nwithout any fault on its part as a consequence of which plaintiff\u2019s premises were flooded with\nwater. It was held that the company was not liable as the company was engaged in performing a\nstatutory duty.\n(v) Act of God\nIf an escape is caused, through natural causes and without human intervention circumstances\nwhich no human foresight can provide against and of which human prudence is not bound to\nrecognize the possibility, there is then said to exist the defence of Act of God.\n(vi) Escape due to plaintiff\u2019s own Default\nDamage by escape due to the plaintiff \u2019s own default was considered to be good defence in\nRylands v. Fletcher itself. Also, if the plaintiff suffers damage by his own intrusion into the defe ndant\u2019s\nproperty, he cannot complain for the damage so caused.\nExample: XYZ Limited is a company engaged in the business of manufacturing of Sun glasses. It has\nstored 1000 litres of transparent spirit which is dangerous, if consumed by humans. A with the inten t to\ncommitting theft, entered into the property of XYZ Limited. After entering into the premises, he cha nged\nhis mind and dropped the idea of theft and decided to go back. While leaving the premises,he saw the\nspirit and drank one glass out of it, misconceiving it with water. He had to hospitalize for 6 Month s due to\nthis. A intends to claim damages under Law of Torts.\nIn this case, Damage  is due to plantiff\u2019s own default. Therefore, he can not claim damages.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 245\nApplicability of the Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher in Cases of Enterprises Engaged in a Hazardous\nor Inherently Dangerous Industry.\nThe Supreme Court has discussed the applicability of the rule of Reylands v. Fletcher in the case of  M.C.\nMehta  v. Union of India and Others (1987) 1. Comp. L.J. p. 99 S.C. while determining the principles on which\nthe liability of an enterprise engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry depended if a n\naccident occurred in such industry.\n\u201cWe have to evolve new principle and lay down new norms which would adequately deal with the new\nproblems which arise in a highly industrialized economy. We cannot allow our judicial thinking to be\nconstricted by reference to the law as it prevails in England or for the matter of that, in any othe r foreign\ncountry\u201d.\nOn the question of the nature of liability for a hazardous enterprise the court while noting that th e above\nrule as developed in England recognizes certain limitations and responsibilities,  recorded its fina l view as\nfollows:\n\u201cWe are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous indus try\nwhich poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the factory and re siding\nin the surrounding areas, owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that no\nharm results to anyone on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity which it\nhas undertaken. The enterprise must be held to be under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or\ninherently dangerous activity in which it is engaged, must be conducted with the highest standards o f\nsafety; and if any harm results on account of such activity, the enterprise must be absolutely liabl e to\ncompensate for such harm; and it should be no answer to the enterprise to say that it had taken all\nreasonable care and that the harm occurred without negligence on its part.\u201d\nThus, while imposing absolute liability for manufacture of hazardous substances, the Supreme Court\nintended that the requirement of non-natural use or the aspect of escape of a dangerous substance,\ncommonly regarded as essential for liability under Rylands  v. Fletcher , need not be proved in India.\nVicarious Liability\nNormally, the tortfeasor is liable for his tort. But in some cases a person may be held liable for t he tort\ncommitted by another. A master is vicariously liable for the tort of his servant, principal for the tort of his\nagent and partners for the tort of a partner. This is known as vicarious liability in tort. The comm on\nexamples of such a liability are:\nEmployer and\nEmployeeMaster\nand\nServantPrincipal\nand\nagentPartners\ninterseVicarious\nLiability\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 246\n(a)Principal and Agent [Specific authority]\nQui facit per alium facit per se \u2013 he who acts through another is acting himself, so that the act of\nthe agent is the act of the principal. When an agent commits a tort in the ordinary course of his\nduties as an agent, the principal is liable for the same. In Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co. (1912) A.C.\n716, the managing clerk of a firm of solicitors, while acting in the ordinary course of business\ncommitted fraud, against a lady client by fraudulently inducing her to sign documents transferring\nher property to him. He had done so without the knowledge of his principal who was liable\nbecause the fraud was committed in the course of employment.\nPartners\nFor the tort committed by a partner in the ordinary course of the business of firm, all the other\npartners are liable to the same extent as the guilty partner. The liability of the partners is joint  and\nseveral. In Hamlyn v . Houston & Co. (1903) 1 K.B. 81, one of the two partners bribed the plaintiff\u2019s\nclerk and induced him to divulge secrets relating to his employer\u2019s business. It was held that both\nthe partners were liable for the tort committed by only one of them.\n(b)Master and Servant [Authority by relation]\nA master is liable for the tort committed by his servant while acting in the course of his employmen t.\nThe servant, of course, is also liable; their liability is joint and several.\nIn such cases (i) liability of a person is independent of his own wrongful intention or negligence\n(ii) liability is joint as well several (iii) In case of vicarious liability the liability arises be cause of the\nrelationship between the principal and the wrongdoer but in case of absolute or strict liability the\nliability arises out of the wrong itself.\nA master is liable not only for the acts which have been committed by the servant, but also for acts\ndone by him which are not specifically authorized, in the course of his employment. The basis of\nthe rule has been variously stated: on the maxim Respondeat Superior (Let the principal be liable)\nor on the maxim Qui facit per alium facit per se (he who does an act through another is deemed\nto do it himself).\nThe master is liable even though the servant acted against the express instructions, for the benefit\nof his master, so long as the servant acted in the course of employment.\n(c)Employer and Independent Contractor\nIt is to be remembered that an employer is vicariously liable for the torts of his servants committe d\nin the course of their employment, but he is not liable for the torts of those who are his independe nt\ncontractors.\nA servant is a person who is employed by another (the employer) to perform services in connection\nwith the affairs of the employer, and over whom the employer has control in the performance of\nthese services. An independent contractor is one who works for another but who is not controlled\nby that other in his conduct in the performance of that work. These definitions show that a person\nis a servant where the employer \u201cretains the control of the actual performance\u201d of the work.\n(d)Where Employer is Liable for the acts of Independent Contractor\nThe employer is not liable merely because an independent contractor commits a tort in the\ncourse of his employment; the employer is liable only if he himself is deemed to have committed\na tort. This may happen in one of the following three ways:\n(i)When employer authorizes him to commit a tort.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 247\n(ii) In torts of strict liability.\n(iii) Negligence of independent contractor.\n(e)Where Employer is not Liable for the acts of an Independent Contractor\nAn employer is not liable for the tort of an independent contractor if he has taken care in the\nappointment of the contractor. In Philips  v. Britania Hygienic Laundry Co. (1923), the owner of\nlorry was held not liable when a third-party\u2019s vehicle was damaged, in consequence of the\nnegligent repair of his lorry by a garage proprietor. Employers of independent contractors are\nliable for the \u201ccollateral negligence\u201d of their contractors in the course of his employment. Where\nA employed B to fit casement windows into certain premises. B\u2019s servant negligently put a tool on\nthe still of the window on which he was working at the time. The wind blew the casement open\nand the tool was knocked off the still on to a passer-by. The employer was held to be liable,\nbecause the harm was caused by the work on a highway and duty lies upon the employer to\navoid harm.\n(f)Liability for the acts of Servants\nAn employer is liable whenever his servant commits a tort in the course of his employment. An act\nis deemed to be done in the course of employment if it is either:\n(i)a wrongful act authorized by the employer, or\n(ii)a wrongful and unauthorized mode of doing some act authorized by the employer.\nSo for as the first alternative is concerned there is no difficulty in holding the master liable for  the\ntort of his servant. A few examples, however, are necessary to explain the working of the rule in\nthe second. These are as follows:\nIn Century Insurance Co. Ltd.  v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board (1942)  A.C. 509, the director\nof a petrol lorry, while transferring petrol from the lorry to an underground tank at a garage,\nstruck a match in order to light a cigarette and then threw it, still alight on the floor. An explos ion\nand a fire ensued. The House of Lords held his employers liable for the damage caused, for he did\nthe act in the course of carrying out his task of delivering petrol; it was an unauthorized way of\ndoing what he was employed to do.\nSimilarly, in Bayley  v . Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Rly. Co.  (1873) L.R. 7 C.P . 415, erroneously\nthinking that the plaintiff was in the wrong train, a porter of the defendants forcibly removed him.\nThe defendants were held liable.\nVicarious Liability of the State\n(a)The Position in England\nAt Common Law the Crown could not be sued in tort, either for wrongs actually authorized by it\nor committed by its servants, in the course of their employment. With the passing of the Crown\nProceeding Act, 1947, the Crown is liable for the torts committed by its servants just like a privat e\nindividual. Thus, in England, the Crown is now vicariously liable for the torts of its servants.\n(b)The Position in India\nUnlike the Crown Proceeding Act, 1947 of England, we have no statutory provision with respect\nto the liability of the State in India.\nWhen a case of Government liability in tort comes before the courts, the question is whether the\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 248\nparticular Government activity, which gave rise to the tort, was the sovereign function or non-\nsovereign function. If it  is a sovereign function it could claim immunity from the tortuous liabili ty,\notherwise not. Generally, the activities of commercial nature or those which can be carried out\nby the private individual are termed as non-sovereign functions.\nThe whole idea of Vicariously Liability of the State for the torts committed by its servants is base d\non three principles:\n\u2022Respondeat superior (let the principal be liable).\n\u2022Quifacit per alium facit per se (he who acts through another does it himself).\n\u2022Socialisation of Compensation.\nThe position of State liability as stated in Article 300 of the Constitution is as under: Clause (1)  of\nArticle 300 of the Constitution provides first, that the Government of India may sue or be sued by\nthe name of the Union of India and the Government of a State may sue or be sued by the name of\nthe State; secondly, that the Government of India or the Government of a State may sue or be\nsued in relation to their respective affairs in the like cases as the Dominion of India and the\ncorresponding Provinces or the corresponding Indian States might have sued or be sued, \u201cif this\nConstitution had not been enacted\u201d, and thirdly, that the second mentioned rule shall be subject\nto any provisions which may be made by an Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of such State,\nenacted by virtue of powers conferred by the Constitution.\nTorts or Wrongs to Personal Safety and Freedom\nAn action for damages lies in the following kinds of wrongs which are styled as injuries to the pers on of an\nindividual:\n(a)Battery\nAny direct application of force to the person of another individual without his consent or lawful\njustification is a wrong of battery. To constitute a tort of battery, therefore, two things are nece ssary:\n(i) use of force, however, trivial it may be without the plaintiff \u2019s consent, and (ii) without any\nlawful justification.\nEven though the force used is very trivial and does not cause any harm, the wrong is committed.\nThus, even to touch a person in anger or without any lawful justification is battery.\n(b)Assault\nAssault is any act of the defendant which directly causes the plaintiff immediately to apprehend a\ncontact with his person. Thus, when the defendant by his act creates an apprehension in the\nmind of the plaintiff that he is going to commit battery against him, the tort of assault is committ ed.\nThe law of assault is substantially the same as that of battery except that apprehension of contact,\nnot the contact itself has to be established. Usually when there is a battery, there will also be\nassault, but not for instance, when a person is hit from behind. To point a loaded gun at the\nplaintiff, or to shake first under his nose, or to curse him in a threatening manner, or to aim a bl ow\nat him which is intercepted, or to surround him with a display of force is to assault him clearly if  the\ndefendant by his act intends to commit a battery and the plaintiff apprehends it, is an assault.\n(c)Bodily Harm\nA wilful act (or statement) of defendant, calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff and in\nfact causing physical harm to him, is a tort.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 249\n(d)False Imprisonment\nFalse imprisonment consists in the imposition of a total restraint for some period, however short,\nupon the liberty of another, without sufficient lawful justification. It means unauthorized restrain t\non a person\u2019s body. What happens in false imprisonment is that a person is confined within certain\nlimits so that he cannot move about and so his personal liberty is infringed. It is a serious violat ion\nof a person\u2019s right and liberty whether being confined within the four walls or by being prevented\nfrom leaving place where he is. If a man is restrained, by a threat of force from leaving his own\nhouse or an open field there is false imprisonment.\n(e)Malicious Prosecution\nMalicious prosecution consists in instigating judicial proceedings (usually criminal) against\nanother, maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause, which terminate in favour of\nthat other and which results in damage to his reputation, personal freedom or property.\nThe following are the essential elements of this tort:\n(i)There must have been a prosecution of the plaintiff by the defendant.\n(ii) There must have been want of reasonable and probable cause for that prosecution.\n(iii) The defendant must have acted maliciously (i.e. with an improper motive and not to further\nthe end of justice).\n(iv) The plaintiff must have suffered damages as a result of the prosecution.\n(v) The prosecution must have terminated in favour of the plaintiff.\nTo be actionable, the proceedings must have been instigated actually by the defendant. If he\nmerely states the fact as he believes them to a policeman or a magistrate he is not responsible for\nany proceedings which might ensue as a result of action by such policeman or magistrate on his\nown initiative.\n(f)Nervous Shock\nThis branch of law is comparatively of recent origin. It provides relief when a person may get\nphysical injury not by an impact, e.g., by stick, bullet or sword but merely by the nervous shock\nthrough what he has seen or heard. Causing of nervous shock itself is not enough to make it an\nactionable tort, some injury or illness must take place as a result of the emotional disturbance,\nfear or sorrow.\n(g)Defamation\nDefamation is an attack on the reputation of a person. It means that something is said or done by\na person which affects the reputation of another. It is defined as follows:\n\u201cDefamation is the publication of a statement which tends to lower a person in the estimation of\nright thinking members of society generally; or which tends to make them shun or avoid that\nperson.\u201d\nDefamation may be classified into two heads: Libel and Slander. Libel is a representation made in\nsome permanent form, e.g. written words, pictures, caricatures, cinema films, effigy, statue and\nrecorded words. In a cinema films both the photographic part of it and the speech which is\nsynchronized with it amount to tort.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 250\nSlander  is the publication of a defamatory statement in a transient form; statement of temporary\nnature such as spoken words, or gestures.\nGenerally, the punishment for libel is more severe than for slander. Defamation is tort as well as a\ncrime in India.\nIn India both libel and slander are treated as a crime. Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code\nrecognizes both libel and slander as an offence. However, torts in criminal law are stricter than in\nlaw of tort.\nRemedies in Torts\nJudicial Remedies\nThree types of judicial remedies are available to the plaintiff in an action for tort namely:\n(a)Damages\nThe courts may award damages against the wrong caused to any person.\n(b)Injunction\nA person may be prohibited to act in a particular way or compelled to do a certain act under the\nremedy of Injunction.\n(c)Specific Restitution of Property\nA person may be asked to restore a property under the Specific Restitution of Property.\nExtra Judicial Remedies\nIn certain cases it is lawful to redress one\u2019s injuries by means of self-help without recourse to th e court.\nThese remedies are:\n(a)Self Defence\nIt is lawful for any person to use reasonable forces to protect himself, or any other person against\nany unlawful use of force.\n(b)Prevention of Trespass\nAn occupier of land or any person with his authority may use reasonable force to prevent\ntrespassers entering or to eject them but the force should be reasonable for the purpose.\n(c)Re-entry on Land\nA person wrongfully disposed of land may retake possession of land if he can do so in a peaceful\nand reasonable manner.\n(d)Re-caption of Goods\nIt is neither a crime nor a tort for a person entitled to possession of a chattel to take it either\npeacefully or by the use of a reasonable force from one who has wrongly taken it or wrongfully\ndetained it.\n(e)Abatement of Nuisance\nThe occupier of land may lawfully abate (i.e. terminate by his own act), any nuisance injuriously\naffecting it. Thus, he may cut overhanging branches as spreading roots from his neighbour\u2019s\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 251\ntrees, but (i) upon giving notice; (ii) by choosing the least mischievous method; (iii) avoiding\nunnecessary damage.\n(f)Distress Damage Feasant\nAn occupier may lawfully seize any cattle or any chattel which are unlawfully on his land doing\ndamage there and detain them until compensation is paid for the damage. The right is known as\nthat of distress damage feasant-to distrain things which are doing damage.\n***\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 252\n252Lesson 3\nELEMENTS\nOF COMPANY\nSECRETARIES\nLEGISLATION\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 253\nTHE INSTITUTE OF COMPANY SECRETARIES OF INDIA\nThe Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) is the only recognized professional body in Ind ia to\ndevelop and regulate the profession of Company Secretaries in India. It is a premier national profes sional\nbody set up under an act of Parliament, the Company Secretaries Act, 1980. ICSI functions under the\njurisdiction of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. The Institute provides top-q uality\neducation to the students of Company Secretaries (CS) Course and best quality set standards to CS\nMembers. At present, there are more than 50,000 members and about 4, 00,000 students on the roll of\nICSI.\nICSI has its headquarters at New Delhi, four Regional Offices at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai  and\nover 70 Chapters across India.\nICSI has been contributing to the initiatives of Government of India that have potential to excel th e social-\neconomic growth of India.\nTHE VISION,  MOTTO, MISSION AND CORE VALUE OF THE INSTITUTE\nVISION\nTo be a global leader in promoting Good Corporate Governance\nMISSION\nTo develop high calibre professionals facilitating good Corporate Governance\nMOTTO\nl R ; a  onA  /k eZ a  pj  A   Speak the Truth, Abide by the Law\nCORE VALUES\nCore values are the expression of beliefs, followed by an individual, group or community in their pe rsonal\nor professional behavior, individually or collectively. The ICSI identifies for itself and its membe rs the\nfollowing core values:\n\u2022Integrity\n\u2022Ethics\n\u2022Reliability\n\u2022Ownership\n\u2022Being \u2018stakeholder-centric\u2019\nIntegrity\nThe ICSI\u2019s vision to be a global leader in promoting Good Corporate Governance is a promise to the\nnation. It casts upon the ICSI and the profession of Company Secretaries a huge responsibility to de liver\nupon this promise, with objectivity and integrity as core values. There is no middle path to integri ty.\nEtymologically, the word \u2018integrity\u2019 derives from the Latin word \u2018integer\u2019 which means whole or comp lete.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 254\nIn this context, integrity may comprise the personal inner sense of wholeness deriving from characte r,\ncourage and consistency. As integrity conveys a sense of wholeness and strength, members shall be\nguided by a set of core principles that will empower them to remain consistent with high standards, viz\ncompassion, dependability, generosity, honesty, openness, transparency, loyalty, maturity, objectivi ty, trust,\nand wisdom.\nEthics\nThe term \u2018ethics\u2019 has its origin from a Greek word \u201cethos\u201d, which means character or custom \u2013 the\ndistinguishing character, moral nature or guiding beliefs of a person, institution or a group.\n\u2018Ethics\u2019 in its simplest form means possessing a sense of right and wrong. Whatever is conscientious ly right\nis ethical; whatever is not, is unethical. In other words, ethics is the sense of right and wrong, c oupled with\na desire to do good in some measure for someone.\nThe ICSI has been built on the principle of ethics and its members continuously strive to promote et hical\npractices, and hold the profession in high esteem, which is integral to maintaining quality and repu tation\nof both, the ICSI and its members.\nBeing \u2018stakeholder-centric\u2019\nThe ICSI, its members and the Team ICSI pledge to uphold the established principles of professional ethics,\nvalues and standards and will always promote honesty and transparency in their behaviour, practices\nand processes.\nReliability\nReliability is an assurance of quality of service and commitment. At the ICSI, reliability is a core  value\nreinforced by stringent processes specially focusing on quality of service, predictability and relia bility. The\nvalues are an intrinsic component of work culture and sustainable growth. Quality and predictability\nthrough commitment and value-added services is what would be the strongest USP of the ICSI and its\nmembers. We shall continuously build on reliability as our core value for it is the sum total of qua lity service\nto our stakeholders.\nOwnership\nOwnership is synonymous with responsibility, accountability and empowerment. The idea of ownership i s\nmuch more than simply a willingness to accept own criticism, deficiency or oversight. It is more abo ut\nsetting one\u2019s priorities, placing rightful obligations on others as high as obligations to self. To be responsible\nis to always do the right things in the eyes of valued stakeholders and the public at large. It is t o value the\ntrust and confidence stakeholders put in them. It is about commitment to keep a promise or make righ t\nsome unintentional wrong, even when it is inconvenient to do so. \u201cOwnership being one of our core\nvalues, we believe that it will reduce risk, increase efficiency and contribute to goodwill, reputat ion and\nbrand image of the Institute and the profession. We shall uphold this at all times.\u201d\nBeing Stakeholder-Centric\nStakeholder is our most valued constituency when it comes to being able to achieve our goals. We\nbelieve in constant stakeholder consultation and in translating their aspirations into achievable go als. We\ntake pride in having a transparent and stakeholder focused approach in having a trustworthy and\ncollaborative relationship with them.\nIt will be our endeavor to constantly activate new channels and pathways to not only meet but beat t he\nexpectations of our stakeholders. This window into the future will help us to achieve sustained perf ormance\nand growth.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 255\nCOMP ANY SECRETARY\nAccording to Section 2(1)(c) of the Company Secretaries Act, 1980 \u201cCompany Secretary\u201d means a person\nwho is a member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India. The role of the Company secretary is\ndefined in various other legal enactments.\nUnder the Companies Act, 2013 Company Secretary has been defined under section 2(24) as: \u2018Company\nSecretary\u2019 or \u2018Secretary\u2019 means a Company Secretary as defined in  Section 2(1)(c)  of the Company\nSecretaries Act, 1980 who is appointed by a company to perform the functions of the Company Secretar y\nunder the Companies Act, 2013.\nCompany Secretary is recognized as one of the Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) of a company under\nthe Companies Act, 2013. Section 203 of Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 8 of the Companies\n(Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel)  Rules, 2014 provides that  every listed\ncompany and every other public company having a paid-up share capital of ten crore rupees or more\nshall have the following whole-time key managerial personnel:\n(i)Managing Director, or Chief Executive Officer or Manager and in their absence, a Whole-Time\nDirector;\n(ii)Company Secretary; and\n(iii)Chief Financial Officer:\nAccording to Rule 8A of the Companies (Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel)\nRules, 2014.

In the leisurely pas t, merchants\ntook advantage of festive gatherings, to discuss business matters. Now a days, the business matters have\nbecome more complicated and cannot be discussed at length at festive gatherings. Therefore, the word\ncompany has assumed greater importance. It denotes a joint stock enterprise in which the capital is\ncontributed by a large number of people. Thus, in popular parlance, a company denotes an association  of\nlike-minded persons formed for the purpose of carrying on some business or undertaking. A company is  a\ncorporate body and a legal person having status and personality distinct and separate from that of t he\nmembers constituting it.\nIt is called a body corporate because the persons composing it are made into one body by incorporati ng\nit according to the law and clothing it with legal personality. The word \u2018corporation\u2019 is derived fr om the\nLatin term \u2018corpus\u2019 which means \u2018body\u2019. Accordingly, \u2018corporation\u2019 is a legal person created by the\nprocess other than natural birth. It is, for this reason, sometimes called artificial legal person. As a legal\nperson, a corporate is capable of enjoying many of the rights and incurring many of the liabilities of a\nnatural person.\nIn the legal sense, a company is an association of both natural and artificial persons incorporated under\nthe existing law of a country. In terms of the Section 2(20) of the Companies Act, 2013, Company mea ns\na company incorporated under this Act or under any previous company law.  In common law, a company\nis a \u201clegal person\u201d or \u201clegal entity\u201d separate from, and capable of surviving beyond the lives of it s members.\nHowever, an association formed not for profit acquires a corporate life and falls within the meaning  of a\ncompany by reason of a licence under Section 8 of the Act.\nBut a company is not merely a legal institution. It is rather a legal device for the attainment of a ny social or\neconomic end. It is, therefore, a combined political, social, economic and legal institution. Thus, the term\ncompany has been described in many ways. \u201cIt is a means of cooperation and organisation in the condu ct\nof an enterprise\u201d. It is \u201can intricate, centralised, economic and administrative structure run by pr ofessional\nmanagers who hire capital from the investor(s)\u201d. Lord Justice James has defined a company as \u201can\nassociation of many persons who contribute money or money\u2019s worth to a common stock and employ it\nin some trade or business and who share the profit and loss arising therefrom. The common stock so\ncontributed is denoted in money and is the capital of the company. The persons who form it, or to wh om\nit belongs, are members. The proportion of capital to which each member is entitled is his \u201cshare\u201d.\nFrom the foregoing discussion it is clear that a company has its own corporate and legal personality\ndistinct and separate from that of its members. A brief description of the various attributes is giv en here to\nexplain the nature and characteristics of the company as a corporate body.\nNATURE & CHARACTERISTICS OF A COMPANY\nSince a corporate body (i.e. a company) is the creation of law, it is not a human being, it is an ar tificial\nperson (i.e. created by law); it is clothed with many rights, obligations, powers and duties prescri bed by\nlaw; it is called a \u2018person\u2019. Being the creation of law , it possesses only the properties conferred upon it by its\nMemorandum of Association. Within the limits of powers conferred by the charter, it can do all acts as a\nnatural person may do.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 264\nThe most striking characteristics of a company are:\n(i)Corporate Personality\nBy incorporation under the Act, the company is vested with a corporate personality quite distinct\nfrom individuals who are its members. Being a separate legal entity it bears its own name and acts\nunder a corporate name. It has a seal of its own. Its assets are separate and distinct from those of\nits members. It is also a different \u2018person\u2019 from the members who compose it. As such it is capable\nof owning property, incurring debts, borrowing money, having a bank account, employing people,\nentering into contracts and suing or being sued in the same manner as an individual. Its members\nare its owners but they can be its creditors simultaneously as it has a separate legal entity. A\nshareholder cannot be held liable for the acts of the company even if he holds virtually the entireCHARACTERISTICS\nOF A COMPANYCorporate\nPersonality\nLimited\nLiability\nPerpetual\nSuccession\nSeparate\nProperty\nTransfera-\nbility of\nShares\nCapacity to\nSue and Be\nSuedContractual\nRightsLimitation of\nActionSeparate\nManagementVoluntary\nAssociation\nfor ProfitTermination\nof Existence\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 265\nshare capital. The shareholders are not the agents of the company and so they cannot bind it by\ntheir acts. The company does not hold its property as an agent or trustee for its members and they\ncannot sue to enforce its rights, nor can they be sued in respect of its liabilities. Thus, \u2018incorpo ration\u2019\nis the act of forming a legal corporation as a juristic person. A juristic person is in law also con ferred\nwith rights and obligations and is dealt with in accordance with law. In other words, the entity\nacts like a natural person but only through a designated person, whose acts are processed within\nthe ambit of law [ Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee  v. Shri Sam Nath Dass  AIR 2000\nSCW 139].\nThe case of Salomon  v. Salomon and Co. Ltd. , (1897) A.C. 22 has clearly established the principle\nthat once a company has been validly constituted under Companies Act, it becomes a legal\nperson distinct from its members and for this purpose it is immaterial whether any member has a\nlarge or small proportion of the shares, and whether he holds those shares beneficially or as a\nmere trustee.\nIn the case, Salomon had, for some years, carried on a prosperous business as a leather merchant\nand boot manufacturer. He formed a limited company consisting of himself, his wife, his daughter\nand his four sons as the shareholders, all of whom subscribed for 1 share each so that the actual\ncash paid as capital was \u00a3 7. Salomon sold his business (which was perfectly solvent at that time),\nto the Company for the sum of \u00a3 38,782. The company\u2019s nominal capital was \u00a3 40,000 in \u00a3 1 shares.\nIn part payment of the purchase money for the business sold to the company, debentures of the\namount of \u00a310,000 secured by a floating charge on the company\u2019s assets were issued to Salomon,\nwho also applied for and received an allotment of 20,000 \u00a3 1 fully paid shares. The remaining\namount of \u00a38,782 was paid to Salomon in cash. Salomon was the managing director and two of\nhis sons were other directors.\nThe company soon ran into difficulties and the debenture holders appointed a receiver and the\ncompany went into liquidation. The total assets of the company amounted to \u00a36050, its liabilities\nwere \u00a310,000 secured by debentures, \u00a38,000 owning to unsecured trade creditors, who claimed\nthe whole of the company\u2019s assets, viz., \u00a36,050, on the ground that, as the company was a mere\n\u2018alias\u2019 or agent for Salomon, they were entitled to payment of their debts in priority to debentures .\nThey further pleaded that Salomon, as principal beneficiary, was ultimately responsible for the\ndebts incurred by his agent or trustee on his behalf.\nTheir Lordships of the House of Lords observed:\n\u201cWhen the memorandum is duly signed and registered, though there be only seven shares taken,\nthe subscribers are a body corporate capable forthwith of exercising all the functions of an\nincorporated company. It is difficult to understand how a body corporate thus created by statute\ncan lose its individuality by issuing the bulk of its capital to one person. The company is at law a\ndifferent person altogether from the subscribers of the memorandum; and though it may be that\nafter incorporation the business is precisely the same as before, the same persons are managers,\nand the same hands receive the profits, the company is not in law their agent or trustee. The\nstatute enacts nothing as to the extent or degree of interest which may be held by each of the\nseven or as to the proportion of interest, or influence possessed by one or majority of the\nshareholders over others. There is nothing in the Act requiring that the subscribers to the\nmemorandum should be independent or unconnected, or that they or any of them should take\na substantial interest in the undertakings, or that they should have a mind or will of their own, or\nthat there should be anything like a balance of power in the constitution of company.\u201d\nThe case of Lee v. Lee\u2019s Air Farming Ltd. (1961) A.C. 12 (P.C.) illustrates the application of the\nprinciples established in Salomon\u2019s case (supra). In this case, a company was formed for the\npurpose of aerial top-dressing. Lee, a qualified pilot, held all but one of the shares in the compan y.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 266\nHe voted himself the managing director and got himself appointed by the articles as chief pilot at\na salary. He was killed in an air crash while working for the company. His widow claimed\ncompensation for the death of her husband in the course of his employment. The company\nopposed the claim on the ground that Lee was not a worker as the same person could not be the\nemployer and the employee. The Privy Council held that Lee and his company were distinct legal\npersons which had entered into contractual relationships under which he became, the chief\npilot, a servant of the company. In his capacity of managing director he could, on behalf of the\ncompany, give himself orders in his other capacity of pilot, and the relationship between himself,\nas pilot and the company, was that of servant and master. Lee was a separate person from the\ncompany he formed and his widow was held entitled to get the compensation. In effect the magic\nof corporate personality enabled him (Lee) to be the master and servant at the same time and\nenjoy the advantages of both.\nThe decision of the Calcutta High Court in Re. Kondoli T ea Co. Ltd. , (1886) ILR 13 Cal. 43, recognised\nthe principle of separate legal entity even much earlier than the decision in Salomon v. Salomon\n& Co. Ltd. case. Certain persons transferred a Tea Estate to a company and claimed exemptions\nfrom ad valorem duty on the ground that since they themselves were also the shareholders in the\ncompany and, therefore, it was nothing but a transfer from them in one name to themselves\nunder another name. While rejecting this Calcutta High Court observed: \u201cThe company was a\nseparate person, a separate body altogether from the shareholders and the transfer was as much\na conveyance, a transfer of the property, as if the shareholders had been totally different persons.\n(ii) Limited Liability\n\u201cThe privilege of limited liability for business debts is one of the principal advantages of doing\nbusiness under the corporate form of organisation.\u201d The company, being a separate person, is the\nowner of its assets and bound by its liabilities. The liability of a member as shareholder, extends to\ncontribution to the assets of the company up to the nominal value of the shares held and not paid\nby him. Members, even as a whole, are neither the owners of the company\u2019s undertakings, nor\nliable for its debts. In other words, a shareholder is liable to pay the balance, if any, due on the\nshares held by him, when called upon to pay and nothing more, even if the liabilities of the\ncompany far exceed its assets. This means that the liability of a member is limited. For example, if\nA holds shares of the total nominal value of Rs. 1,000 and has already paid Rs. 500/- (or 50% of the\nvalue) as part payment at the time of allotment, he cannot be called upon to pay more than Rs.\n500/-, the amount remaining unpaid on his shares. If he holds fully-paid shares, he has no further\nliability to pay even if the company is declared insolvent. In the case of a company limited by\nguarantee, the liability of members is limited to a specified amount mentioned in the memorandum.\nBuckley, J. in Re. London and Globe Finance Corporation , (1903) 1 Ch.D. 728 at 731, has observed:\n\u2018The statutes relating to limited liability have probably done more than any legislation of the last\nfifty years to further the commercial prosperity of the country. They have, to the advantage of the\ninvestor as well as of the public, allowed and encouraged aggregation of small sums into large\ncapitals which have been employed in undertakings of \u201cgreat public utility largely increasing the\nwealth of the country\u201d.\nThere are, however, some statutory exceptions to the principle of limited liability. As the Companie s\nAct, 2013 the members become personally liable if the membership falls below prescribed minimum\nand the business is carried on for more than six months thereafter.\n(iii) Perpetual Succession\nAn incorporated company never dies except when it is wound up as per law. A company, being a\nseparate legal person is unaffected by death or departure of any member and remains the same\nentity, despite total change in the membership. A company\u2019s life is determined by the terms of its\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 267\nMemorandum of Association. It may be perpetual or it may continue for a specified time to carry\non a task or object as laid down in the Memorandum of Association. Perpetual succession,\ntherefore, means that the membership of a company may keep changing from time to time, but\nthat does not affect its continuity.\nThe membership of an incorporated company may change either because one shareholder has\ntransferred his shares to another or his shares devolve on his legal representatives on his death\nor he ceases to be a member under some other provisions of the Companies Act. Thus, perpetual\nsuccession denotes the ability of a company to maintain its existence by the constant succession\nof new individuals who step into the shoes of those who cease to be members of the company.\nProfessor L.C.B. Gower rightly mentions, \u201cMembers may come and go, but the company can go\non for ever. During the war all the members of one private company, while in general meeting,\nwere killed by a bomb, but the company survived \u2014 not even a hydrogen bomb could have\ndestroyed it\u201d.\n(iv) Separate Property\nA company being a legal person and entirely distinct from its members, is capable of owning,\nenjoying and disposing of property in its own name. The company is the real person in which all\nits property is vested, and by which it is controlled, managed and disposed off. Their Lordships of\nthe Madras High Court in R.F. Perumal  v. H. John Deavin , A.I.R. 1960 Mad. 43 held that \u201cno\nmember can claim himself to be the owner of the company\u2019s property during its existence or in its\nwinding-up\u201d. A member does not even have an insurable interest in the property of the company.\n(v)Transferability of Shares\nThe capital of a company is divided into parts, called shares. The shares are said to be movable\nproperty and, subject to certain conditions, freely transferable, so that no shareholder is\npermanently or necessarily wedded to a company. When the joint stock companies were\nestablished, the object was that their shares should be capable of being easily transferred, [In Re.\nBalia and San Francisco Rly ., (1968) L.R. 3 Q.B. 588]. Companies Act, 2013 enunciates the principle\nby providing that the shares held by the members are movable property and can be transferred\nfrom one person to another in the manner provided by the articles.\nA member may sell his shares in the open market and realise the money invested by him. This\nprovides liquidity to a member (as he can freely sell his shares) and ensures stability to the compa ny\n(as the member is not withdrawing his money from the company). The Stock Exchanges provide\nadequate facilities for the sale and purchase of shares.\nFurther, as of now, in most of the listed companies, the shares are also transferable through\nElectronic mode i.e. through Depository Participants instead of physical transfers.\n(vi) Capacity to Sue and Be Sued\nA company being a body corporate, can sue and be sued in its own name. To sue, means to\ninstitute legal proceedings against (a person) or to bring a suit in a court of law. All legal proce edings\nagainst the company are to be instituted in its own name. Similarly, the company may bring an\naction against anyone in its own name. A company\u2019s right to sue arises when some loss is caused\nto the company, i.e. to the property of the personality of the company. Hence, the company is\nentitled to sue for damages in libel or slander as the case may be [ Floating Services Ltd.  v. MV San\nFransceco Dipaloa (2004) 52 SCL 762 (Guj)]. A company, as a person separate from its members,\nmay even sue one of its own members for libel.\nA company has a right to seek damages where a defamatory material published about it, affects its\nbusiness. Where video cassettes were prepared by the workmen of a company showing, their\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 268\nstruggle against the company\u2019s management, it was held to be not actionable unless shown that\nthe cassette would be defamatory. The court did not restrain the exhibition of the cassette. [ TVS\nEmployees Federation  v. TVS and Sons Ltd. , (1996) 87 Com Cases 37]. The company is not held\nliable for contempt committed by its officer. [ Lalit Surajmal Kanodia   v. Office Tiger Database Systems\nIndia (P) Ltd. , (2006) 129 Comp Cas 192 Mad].\n(vii) Contractual Rights\nA company, being a separate legal entity different from its members, can enter into contracts for\nthe conduct of the business in its own name. A shareholder cannot enforce a contract made by\nhis company; he is neither a party to the contract nor entitled to the benefit of it, as a company i s\nnot a trustee for its shareholders. Likewise, a shareholder cannot be sued on contracts made by\nhis company. The distinction between a company and its members is not confined to the rules of\nprivity, however, it permeates the whole law of contract. Thus, if a director fails to disclose a\nbreach of his duties to his company, and in consequence a shareholder is induced to enter into\na contract with the director which he would not have entered into had there been disclosure,\nthe shareholder cannot rescind the contract.\nSimilarly, a member of a company cannot sue in respect of torts committed against the company,\nnor can he be sued for torts committed by the company. [ British Thomson-Houston Company  v.\nSterling Accessories Ltd. , (1924) 2 Ch. 33]. Therefore, the company as a legal person can take\naction to enforce its legal rights or be sued for breach of its legal duties. Its rights and duties are\ndistinct from those of its constituent members.\n(viii) Limitation of Action\nA company cannot go beyond the power stated in the Memorandum of Association. The\nMemorandum of Association of the company regulates the powers and fixes the objects of the\ncompany and provides the edifice upon which the entire structure of the company rests. The\nactions and objects of the company are limited within the scope of its Memorandum of Association.\nIn order to enable it to carry out its actions without such restrictions and limitations in most cas es,\nsufficient powers are granted in the Memorandum of Association. But once the powers have\nbeen laid down, it cannot go beyond these powers unless the Memorandum of Association is\nitself altered prior to doing so.\n(ix) Separate Management\nAs already noted, the members may derive profits without being burdened with the management\nof the company. They do not have effective and intimate control over its working and elect their\nrepresentatives to conduct corporate functioning. In other words, the company is administered\nand managed by its managerial personnel.\n(x)Voluntary Association for Profit\nA company is a voluntary association for profit. It is formed for the accomplishment of some public\ngoals and whatsoever profit is gained is divided among its shareholders or restored for the future\nexpansion of the company.  Only a Section 8 company can be formed with no profit motive.\n(xi) T ermination of Existence\nA company, being an abstract and artificial person, does not die a natural death. It is created by\nlaw, carries on its affairs according to law throughout its life and ultimately is effaced by law.\nGenerally, the existence of a company is terminated by means of winding up. However, to avoid\nwinding up sometimes companies change their form by means of reorganisation, reconstruction\nand amalgamation.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 269\nTo sum up, \u201ca company is a voluntary association for profit with capital divisible into transferable\nshares with limited liability, having corporate entity and a common seal with perpetual succession\u201d.\nNATIONALITY & RESIDENCE OF A COMPANY\nThough it is established through judicial decisions that a company cannot be a citizen, yet it has n ationality,\ndomicile and residence. In Gasque v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, (1940) 2 K.B. 88, Macnaghten. J.\nheld that a limited company is capable of having a domicile and its domicile is the place of its reg istration\nand that domicile clings to it throughout its existence. He observed in this case:\n\u201cIt was suggested that a body corp3orate has no domicile. It is quite true that a body corporate can not\nhave a domicile in the same sense as an individual. But by analogy with a natural person the attribu tes of\nresidence, domicile and nationality can be given to a body corporate.\u201d\nIn Tulika  v. Parry and Co. , (1903) I.L.R. 27 Mad. 315, Kelly C.B. observed:\n\u201cA joint stock company resides where its place of incorporation is, where the meetings of the whole\ncompany or those who represent it are held and where its governing body meets in bodily presence for\nthe purposes of the company and exercises the powers conferred upon it by statute and by the Article s of\nAssociation.\u201d\nThe company, though a legal person, is not a citizen under the Citizenship Act, 1955 or the Constitu tion\nof India. In State Trading Corporation of India Ltd.  v. C.T.O. , A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1811, the Supreme Court held\nthat the State Trading Corporation though a legal person, was not a citizen and can act only through\nnatural persons. Nevertheless, it is to be noted that certain fundamental rights enshrined in the Co nstitution\nfor protection of \u201cperson\u201d, e.g., right to equality (Article 14) etc. are available to company.\nCONCEPT OF CORPORATE PERSONALITY\nBy the provision of law, a corporation is clothed with a distinct personality, yet in reality it is an association\nof persons who are in fact, in a way, the beneficial owners of the property of the body corporate. A\ncompany, being an artificial person, cannot act on its own, it can only act through natural persons.\nLifting of or piercing through the corporate veil\nIt means the company has a separate legal entity from the persons constituting its members. Indeed, the\ntheory of corporate entity is still the basic principle on which the whole law of corporations is ba sed. But\nas the separate personality of the company is a statutory privilege, it must be used for legitimate business\npurposes only. Where a fraudulent and dishonest use is made of the legal entity, the individuals con cerned\nwill not be allowed to take shelter behind the corporate personality. The Court will break through t he\ncorporate shell and apply the principle of what is known as \u201clifting of or piercing through the corp orate\nveil\u201d. The Court will look behind the corporate entity and take action as though no entity separate from\nthe members existed and make the members or the controlling persons liable for debts and obligations  of\nthe company\nThe corporate veil is lifted when in defence proceedings, such as for the evasion of tax, an entity relies on\nits corporate personality as a shield to cover its wrong doings. [ BSN (UK) Ltd.  v . Janardan Mohandas  Rajan\nPillai [1996] 86 Comp. Cas. 371 (Bom).].\nHowever, the shareholders cannot ask for lifting veil for their purposes. This was upheld in Premlata  Bhatia\nv. Union of India (2004) 58 CL 217 (Delhi) wherein the premises of a shop were allotted on a licence to the\nindividual licence. She set up a wholly owned private company and transferred the premises to that\ncompany with the Government consent. She could not remove the illegality by saying that she and her\ncompany were virtually the same person.\nEver since the decision in the  Salomon  v . Salomon & Co. Ltd. , (1897) A.C. 22 normally Courts are reluctant\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 270\nor at least very cautious to lift the veil of corporate personality to see the real persons behind i t. Nevertheless,\nCourts have found it necessary to disregard the separate personality of a company in the following\nsituations:\n(a)Where the corporate veil has been used for commission of fraud or improper conduct. In such a\nsituation, Courts have lifted the veil and looked at the realities of the situation.\n(b)Where a corporate facade is really only an agency instrumentality.\n(c)Where the doctrine conflicts with public policy, courts lifted the corporate veil for protecting the\npublic policy.\n(d)Further, In Daimler Co. Ltd.  v . Continental Tyre & Rubber Co. , (1916) 2 A.C. 307, it was held that a\ncompany will be regarded as having enemy character, if the persons having de facto control of its\naffairs are resident in an enemy country or , wherever they may be, are acting under instructions\nfrom or on behalf of the enemy.\n(e)Where it was found that the sole purpose for which the company was formed was to evade taxes\nthe Court will ignore the concept of separate entity, and make the individuals liable to pay the\ntaxes which they would have paid but for the formation of the company.\n(f)     Avoidance of welfare legislation is as common as avoidance of taxation and the approach in\nconsidering problems arising out of such avoidance has necessarily to be the same and, therefore,\nwhere it was found that the sole purpose for the formation of the new company was to use it as a\ndevice to reduce the amount to be paid by way of bonus to workmen, the Supreme Court upheld\nthe piercing of the veil to look at the real transaction.\n(g)Where it is found that a company has abused its corporate personality for an unjust and inequitable\npurpose, the court would not hesitate to lift the corporate veil. Further, the corporate veil could\nbe lifted when acts of a corporation are allegedly opposed to justice, convenience and interests\nof revenue or workman or are against public interest.\nThus, in appropriate cases, the Courts disregard the separate corporate personality and look behind the\nlegal person or lift the corporate veil.\nCOMPANY AS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER BUSINESS ENTERPRISES\nThough there are a number of similarities between a limited company and other forms of associations,\nthere are a great number of dissimilarities as well. In both the cases individuals are the subjects,  and\ntrading is generally the object. In the following paragraphs, a limited company is distinguished fro m a\npartnership firm, a Hindu Joint family business and a registered society.\nDistinction between Company and Partnership\nThe principal points of distinction between a company and a partnership firm, are as follows:\n(1) A company is a distinct legal person. A partnership firm is not distinct from the several persons\nwho compose it.\n(2) In a partnership, the property of the firm is the property of the individuals comprising it. In a\ncompany, it belongs to the company and not to the individuals comprising it.\n(3) Creditors of a partnership firm are creditors of individual partners and a decree against the firm\ncan be executed against the partners jointly and severally. The creditors of a company can\nproceed only against the company and not against its members.\n(4) Partners are the agents of the firm, but members of a company are not its agents. A partner can\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 271\ndispose of the property and incur liabilities as long as he acts in the course of the firm\u2019s busines s.\nA member of a company has no such power.\n(5) A partner cannot contract with his firm, whereas a member of a company can.\n(6) A partner cannot transfer his share and make the transferee a member of the firm without the\nconsent of the other partners, whereas a company\u2019s share can ordinarily be transferred.\n(7) Restrictions on a partner\u2019s authority contained in the partnership contract do not bind outsiders;\nwhereas such restrictions incorporated in the Articles are effective, because the public are bound\nto acquaint themselves with them.\n(8) A partner\u2019s liability is always unlimited whereas that of shareholder may be limited either by share s\nor a guarantee.\n(9) A company has perpetual succession, i.e. the death or insolvency of a shareholder or all of them\ndoes not affect the life of the company, whereas the death or insolvency of a partner dissolves the\nfirm, unless otherwise provided.\n(10) A company is legally required to have its accounts audited annually by a chartered accountant,\nwhereas the accounts of a firm are audited at the discretion of the partners.\n(11) A company, being a creation of law, can only be dissolved as laid down by law. A partnership firm,\non the other hand, is the result of an agreement and can be dissolved at any time by agreement.\nDistinction between Company and Hindu Joint Family Business\n1.A company consists of heterogeneous (varied or diverse) members, whereas a Hindu Undivided\nFamily Business consists of homogenous (unvarying) members since it consists of members of the\njoint family itself.\n2.In a Hindu Joint Family business the Karta (manager) has the sole authority to contract debts for\nthe purpose of the business, other coparceners cannot do so. There is no such system in a\ncompany.\n3.A person becomes a member of Joint Hindu Family business by virtue of birth. There is no\nprovision to that effect in the company.\n4.No registration is compulsory for carrying on business for gain by a Hindu Joint Family even if the\nnumber of members exceeds twenty [Shyamlal Roy v . Madhusudan Roy, AIR 1959 Cal. 380 (385)].\nRegistration of a company is compulsory.\nDistinction between company and Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)\nLLP is an alternative corporate business form that gives the benefits of limited liability of a comp any and the\nflexibility of a partnership. LLP can continue its existence irrespective of changes in partners. It  is capable\nof entering into contracts and holding property in its own name. LLP is a separate legal entity, is liable to\nthe full extent of its assets but liability of the partners is limited to their agreed contribution in the LLP.\nFurther, no partner is liable on account of the independent or un-authorized actions of other partne rs,\nthus individual partners are shielded from joint liability created by another partner\u2019s wrongful bus iness\ndecisions or misconduct.\nMutual rights and duties of the partners within a LLP are governed by an agreement between the partn ers\nor between the partners and the LLP as the case may be. The LLP, however, is not relieved of the lia bility\nfor its other obligations as a separate entity.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 272\nSince LLP contains elements of both \u2018a corporate structure\u2019 as well as \u2018a partnership firm structure \u2019 LLP is\ncalled a hybrid between a company and a partnership.\nLLP is a body corporate and a legal entity separate from its partners, having perpetual succession. LLP\nform is a form of business model which :(i) is organized and operates on the basis of an agreement.( ii)\nprovides flexibility without imposing  detailed legal and procedural requirements (iii) enables prof essional/\ntechnical expertise and initiative to combine with financial risk taking capacity in an innovative a nd\nefficient manner\nA basic difference between an LLP and a company lies in that the internal governance structure of a\ncompany is regulated by statute (i.e. Companies Act) whereas for an LLP it would be by a contractual\nagreement between partners.\nThe management-ownership divide inherent in a company is not there in a limited liability partnershi p.\nLLP have more flexibility as compared to a company. LLP have lesser compliance requirements as compa red\nto a company.\nDISADVANTAGES OF CORPORATE FORM OF ENTERPRISE\nThere are, however, certain disadvantages and inconveniences in Incorporation. Some of these\ndisadvantages are:\n1.Expenses of Incorporation and Floation  : Incorporation of a company is coupled with complex,\ncumbersome and detailed legal formalities and procedures, involving considerable amount of\ntime and money. Even after the company is incorporated, its affairs and working must be conducted\nstrictly in accordance with legal provisions. Thus various returns and documents are required to\nbe filed with the Registrar of Companies, some periodically and some on the happening of an\nevent. Certain books and registers are compulsorily required to be maintained by a company.\nApproval and sanction of the Company Law Board, the Government, the Court, the Registrar of\nCompanies or other appropriate authority, as the case may be, is necessarily required to be\nobtained for certain corporate activities.\n2.Corporate disclosures : Notwithstanding the elaborate legal framework designed to ensure\nmaximum disclosure of corporate information, the members of a company comparatively have\nrestricted accessibility to its internal management and day-to-day administration of corporate\nworking.\n  3.Separation of control from ownership  : Members of a company do not have an effective and\nintimate control over its working as one can have in other forms of business organisation, say, a\npartnership firm. This is particularly so in big companies in which the number of members is too\nlarge to exercise  any effective control over its day-to-day affairs.\n4.Greater social responsibility : Having regard to the enormous powers wielded  by the companiesDISADVANTAGES OF CORPORATE FORM OF\nENTERPRISE\nFormalities\nand expensesCorporate\ndisclosuresSeparation of\ncontrol from\nownershipGreater social\nresponsibilityGreater tax\nburden in\ncertain casesDetailed\nwinding-up\nprocedure\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 273\nand the impact they have on the society, the companies are called upon to show greater social\nresponsibility in their working and, for that purpose, are subject to greater control and regulation\nthan that by which other forms of business organisation are governed and regulated.\n5.Greater tax burden in certain cases : In certain circumstances, the tax burden on a company is\nmore than that on other forms of business organization including partnership firms.\n6.Detailed winding-up procedure  : The Act provides elaborate and detailed procedure for winding-\nup of companies which is more expensive and time consuming than that which is applicable to\nother forms of business organisation.\nJOURNEY OF INDIAN COMPANY LAW\nCompany Law in India, as indicated earlier, is the cherished child of the English parents. Our vario us\nCompanies Acts have been modelled on the English Acts. Following the enactment of the Joint Stock\nCompanies Act, 1844 in England, the first Companies Act was passed in India in 1850. It provided for  the\nregistration of the companies and transferability of shares. The Amending Act of 1857 conferred the right\nof registration with or without limited liability. Subsequently this right was granted to banking an d insurance\ncompanies by an Act of 1860 following the similar principle in Britain. The Companies Act of 1856 re pealed\nall the previous Acts. That Act provided inter alia for incorporation, regulation and winding up of\ncompanies and other associations. This Act was recast in 1882, embodying the amendments which were\nmade in the Company Law in England upto that time. In 1913 a consolidating Act was passed, and major\namendments were made to the consolidated Act in 1936. In the meantime England passed a\ncomprehensive Companies Act in 1948. In 1951, the Indian Government promulgated the Indian\nCompanies (Amendment) Ordinance under which the Central Government and the Court assumed\nextensive powers to intervene directly in the affairs of the company and to take necessary action in  the\ninterest of the company. The ordinance was replaced by an Amending Act of 1951.\nThe Companies Act, 1956 was enacted with a view to consolidate and amend the earlier laws relating t o\ncompanies and certain other associations. The Act came into force on 1st April, 1956. The present\nCompanies Act is based largely on the recommendations of the Company Law Committee (Bhabha\nCommittee) which submitted its report in March, 1952. This Act is the longest piece of legislation e ver\npassed by our Parliament. Amendments have been made in this Act periodically. The Companies Act\nconsists of 658 Sections and 15 Schedules.\nFull and fair disclosure of various matters in prospectus; detailed information of the financial aff airs of\ncompany to be disclosed in its account; provision for intervention and investigation by the Governme nt\ninto the affairs of a company; restrictions on the powers of managerial personnel; enforcement of pr oper\nperformance of their duties by company management; and protection of minority shareholders were\nsome of the main features of the Companies Act, 1956.\nThe Companies Act, 1956 has undergone changes by amendments in 1960, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966,\n1967, 1969, 1971, 1977, 1985, 1988, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2002 (Amendment), 2002 (Second Amendment),\nand 2006.\nCONCEPT PAPER ON COMPANY LAW , 2004 & J.J. IRANI REPORT\nTo frame a law that enables companies to achieve global competitiveness in a fast changing economy, the\nGovernment had taken up a fresh exercise for a comprehensive revision of the Companies Act, 1956,\nalbeit through a consultative process. As the first step in this direction, a Concept Paper on Compa ny Law\ndrawn up in the legislative format was exposed for public viewing on the electronic media so that al l\ninterested parties may not only express their opinions on the concepts involved but may also suggest\nformulations on various aspects of Company Law.\nThe response to the concept paper on Company Law was tremendous. The Government, therefore, felt\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 274\nit appropriate that the proposals contained in the Concept Paper and suggestions received thereon be\nput to merited evaluation by an independent Expert Committee. A Committee was constituted on 2nd\nDecember, 2004 under the Chairmanship of Dr. J J Irani, the then Director, Tata Sons, with the task of\nadvising the Government on the proposed revisions to the Companies Act, 1956 with the objective to\nhave a simplified compact law that will be able to address the changes taking place in the national and\ninternational scenario, enable the adoption of internationally accepted best practices as well as pr ovide\nadequate flexibility for timely evolution of new arrangements in response to the requirements of eve r-\nchanging business models. The Committee submitted its report to the Government on 31st May 2005.\nDr. J J Irani Expert Committee on Company Law had submitted its report charting out the road map for  a\nflexible, dynamic and user-friendly new company law. The Committee had taken a pragmatic approach\nkeeping in view the ground realities, and had sought to address the concerns of all the stakeholders  to\nenable adoption of internationally accepted best practices. As one wades through the report, one fin ds\nan arduous zeal to ensure that flexibility is coupled with accountability and transparency. Be it th e role of\ndirectors in the management of the company or the role of promoters at the time of incorporation or the\nresponsibility of professionals in ensuring better governance, the report had made very dynamic and\nbalanced recommendations. The Report of the Committee had also sought to bring in multifarious\nprogressive and visionary concepts and endeavored to recommend a significant shift from the\n\u201cGovernment Approval Regime\u201d to a \u201cShareholder Approval and Disclosure Regime\u201d.\nThe Expert Committee had recommended that private and small companies need to be given flexibilities\nand freedom of operations and compliance at a low cost.  Companies with higher public interest shoul d\nbe subject to a stricter regime of Corporate Governance. Further, Government companies and public\nfinancial institutions should be subject to similar parameters with respect to disclosures and Corpo rate\nGovernance as other companies are subjected to.\nTo attune the Indian Company Law with the global reforms taking place in the arena, the Report of th e\nCommittee had sought to bring in multifarious visionary concepts, which if accepted and acted upon\nwould really simplify the voluminous and cumbersome Companies Act in the country.\nImportant Committees recommending changes to the Companies Act\n1952 Bhabha Committee - The Government of India appointed a Committee of twelve members\nrepresenting various interests under the chairmanship of Shri C.H.

The Bill promised greater shareholder\ndemocracy, vesting the shareholders with greater powers, containing stricter corporate governance\nnorms and requiring greater disclosures. The Companies Bill, 2009 after introduction in Parliament w as\nreferred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance for examination which submitted its repo rt\nto Parliament on 31st August, 2010. Certain amendments were introduced in the Bill in the light of t he\nreport of the Committee and a revised Companies Bill, 2011 was introduced. This version was also ref erred\nto the Hon\u2019ble Committee, which suggested certain further amendments. The amended Bill was passed\nby the Lok Sabha on 18th December, 2012 and by the Rajya Sabha on 8th August, 2013.

The Insolvency\nand Bankruptcy Code, 2016 led to omission of various sections i.e. section 253 to section 269, secti on 289,\nsection 304 to section 323 and section 325. The Finance Act, 2017 amended section 182 with regard to\nprohibitions and restrictions regarding political contributions. So far Ministry has come out with s everal\ncirculars, notifications, Orders and various amendment rules to facilitate better and smooth impleme ntation\nof the Act.\nThe Companies Act 2013 introduced new concepts supporting enhanced disclosure, accountability,\nbetter board governance, and better facilitation of business and so on.

Business ethics is the applica tion of\ngeneral ethical ideas to business behaviour. Ethical business behaviour facilitates and promotes goo d to\nsociety, improves profitability, fosters business relations and employee productivity. The concept o f business\nethics has come to mean various things to various people, but generally it\u2018s coming to know what is right\nor wrong in the workplace and doing what\u2018s right - this is in regard to effects of products/ service s and in\nrelationships with stakeholders. Business ethics is concerned with the behaviour of a businessman in\ndoing a business. Unethical practices are creating problems to businessman and business units. The l ife\nand growth of a business unit depends upon the ethics practiced by a businessman. Business ethics ar e\ndeveloped over the passage of time and custom. A custom differs from one business to another. If a\ncustom is adopted and accepted by businessman and public, that custom will become an ethic. Business\nethics is applicable to every type of business. The social responsibility of a business requires the  observing\nof business ethics. A business man should not ignore the business ethics while assuming social respo nsibility.\nBusiness ethics means the behaviour of a businessman while conducting a business, by observing moral ity\nin his business activities. According to Wheeler, Business Ethics is an art and science for maintain ing\nharmonious relationship with society, its various groups and institutions as well as reorganizing th e moral\nresponsibility for the rightness and wrongness of business conduct. According to Rogene. A. Buchholz ,\nBusiness ethics refers to right or wrong behaviour in business decisions.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 289\nBusiness Ethics or Ethical standards are the principles, practices and philosophies that guide the b usiness\npeople in the day to day business decisions. It relates to the behaviour of a businessman in a busin ess\nsituation. They are concerned primarily with the impacts of decisions on the society within and outs ide\nthe business organizations or other groups who keep interest in the business activities. Business et hics can\nbe said to begin where the law ends. Business ethics is primarily concerned with those issues not co vered\nby the law, or where there is no definite consensus on whether something is right or wrong. - School  of\nDistance Education.\nThe Principles of business ethics developed by well-known authorities like Cantt, J. S.Mill, Herbert  Spencer,\nPlato, Thomas Garret, Woodrad, Wilson etc are as follows:\n1.Sacredness of means and ends : The first and most important principle of business ethics emphasizes\nthat the means and techniques adopted to serve the business ends must be sacred and pure. It\nmeans that a good end cannot be attained with wrong means, even if it is beneficial to the\nsociety.\n2.Not to do any evil : It is unethical to do a major evil to another or to oneself, whether this evil is a\nmeans or an end.\n3.Principle of proportionality  : This principle suggests that one should make proper judgment before\ndoing anything so that there is a fair view taken & others do not suffer from any loss or risk of ev ils\nby the conduct of business.\n4.Non-co-operation in evils : It clearly pints out that a business should not co-operate with any one\nfor doing any evil acts.\n5.Co-operation with others  : This principles state that business should help others only in that condition\nwhen others deserve help.\n6.Publicity  : According to W . Wilson, anything that is being done or to be done, should be brought\nto the knowledge of everyone. If everyone knows, none gets opportunity to do an unethical act.\n7.Equivalent price : According to W . Wilson, the people are entitled to get goods equivalent to the\nvalue of money that they will pay.\n8.Universal value : According to this principle the conduct of business should be done on the basis\nof universal values.\n9.Human dignity : As per this principle, man should not be treated as a factor of production and\nhuman dignity should be maintained.\n10. Non-violence  : If businessman hurts the interests and rights of the society and exploits the consumer\nby overlooking their interests this is equivalent to violence and unethical act.\nETHICAL DILEMMA\nDilemma is a situation that requires a choice between options that are or seem equally unfavorable o r\nmutually exclusive. By definition, an ethical dilemma involves the need to choose from among two or\nmore morally acceptable courses of action, when one choice prevents selecting the other; or, the nee d to\nchoose between equally unacceptable alternatives (Hamric, Spross, and Hanson, 2000).\n A dilemma could be a right vs. wrong situation  in which the right would be more difficult to pursue and\nwrong would be more convenient. A right versus wrong dilemma is not so easy to resolve. It often\ninvolves an apparent conflict between moral imperatives, in which to obey one would result in transg ressing\nthe other. This is also called an ethical paradox.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 290\n An ethical dilemma involves a situation that makes a person question what is the \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019  thing\nto do. They make individuals think about their obligations, duties or responsibilities. These dilemm as can\nbe highly complex and difficult to resolve. Easier dilemmas involve a \u2018right\u2019 versus \u2018wrong\u2019 answer;  whereas,\ncomplex ethical dilemmas involve a decision between a right and another right choice. However, any\ndilemma needs to be resolved.\nAddressing Ethical Dilemmas\nThe ethical dilemma consideration takes us into the grey zone of business and professional life, whe re\nthings are no longer black or white and where ethics has its vital role today. A dilemma is a situat ion that\nrequires a choice between equally balanced arguments or a predicament that seemingly defies a satisf actory\nsolution. An ethical dilemma is a moral situation in which a choice has to be made between two equal ly\nundesirable alternatives. Dilemmas may arise out of various sources of behaviour or attitude, as for\ninstance, it may arise out of failure of personal character, conflict of personal values and organiz ational\ngoals, organizational goals versus social values, etc.\nA business dilemma exists when an organizational decision maker faces a choice between two or more\noptions that will have various impacts on:\n(i)The organization\u2019s profitability and competitiveness; and\n(ii)Its stakeholders.\nIn situations of this kind, one must act out of prudence to take a better decision.\n***\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 291\n291Lesson 5\nLEGAL\nREASONING\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 292\nLEGAL TERMINOL OGY AND MAXIMS\nA priori  : From the antecedent to the consequent.\nAb initio  : From the beginning.\nAbsolute sententia expositore non-indigent  : Plain words require no explanation.\nActio mixta  : Mixed action.\nActio personalis moritur cum persona  : A personal right of action dies with the person.\nActionable per se  : The very act is punishable and no proof of damage is required.\nActus Curiae Neminem Gravabit  : Act of the Court shall prejudice no one.\nActus non facit reumnisi mens sit rea  : An act does not make a man guilty unless there be guilty intention.\nActus reus  : Wrongful act.\nAd hoc : For the particular end or case at hand.\nAd idem : At the same point.\nAd valorem  : According to value.\nAliunde  : From another source.\nAmicus Curiae  : A friend of court member of the bar who is appointed to assist the Court.\nAnimus possidendi  : Intention to possess\nAudi alteram partem : Hear the other side.\nBenami : Nameless.\nBona fide  : Good faith;

Legal Principle : The defendant is liable if he makes a non-natural use of land.\nFactual Situation  : Mr. Kundan had stored chemicals on his land which escaped and caused\ndamaged to the adjacent properties one of which belonged to Mr. Ankit. Mr. Ankit is\nDecide\n(a)Fail because Mr. Kundan had stored chemicals on his own property.\n(b)Succeed because storing chemicals is a non-natural use of land.\n(c)Fail because storing chemicals is a natural use of land.\n(d)Fail because Mr. Ankit should have taken adequate precautions against the chemicals.\n15. Legal Principle : Absolute or strict liability are exceptions to the requirement of mens rea.\nFactual Situation  : B, a mill owner employed independent contractors, who were apparently\ncompetent to construct a reservoir on his land to provide water for his mill. There were old\ndisused mining shafts under the site of the reservoir which the contractors failed to observe\nbecause they were filled with earth. The contractors therefore, did not block them. When the\nwater was filled in the reservoir, it bursts through the shafts and flooded the plaintiff\u2019s coal min es\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 302\non the adjoining land. It was found as a fact that B did not know of the shafts and had not been\nnegligent.\nDecide\n(a)Even though the independent contractors had been negligible, B will be held liable for the\nlosses suffered by the plaintiff.\n(b)B will be held liable for the losses suffered by the plaintiff only if B was negligent and not\notherwise.\n(c)Independent contractors would be liable to the plaintiff as there is privity of contract between\nthem.\n(d)Neither B nor the independent contractors would be held liable as there was no guilty mind\nat work.\n16. Legal Principle : For the tort committed by a partner in the ordinary course of the business of the\nfirm, all the other partners are liable to the same extent as the guilty partner.\nFactual Situation : A, B and C ran a Chartered Accountancy firm in parternership. In order to\nsolicit work from a big bank, A, one of the three partners bribed the Bank\u2019s senior manager and\ninduced him to hand over the audit work to their firm.\nDecide\n(a)All the partners are liable for the tort committed by only one of them.\n(b)Only the partner who paid the bribe is liable.\n(c)Whether or not all partners are liable would depend on the fact whether B and C had\nknowledge of bribe or not.\n(d)The liability of B and C would be established only if they had given there written consent to A\nto bribe the bank official.\n17. Legal Principle  : The State can claim immunity from the tortuous liability only in the cases of\nsovereign function, otherwise not.\nFactual Position  : Chandra and his father Gopal were lodged in a jail, wherein one day bombs\nwere hurled at them by their rivals, causing the death of Gopal and injuries Chandra. The victims\nwere having previous knowledge of the impending attack, which they conveyed to the authorities,\nbut no additional security was provided to them. On the contrary, there was gross negligence\nsince there was a great relaxation in the number of police men who were to guard the jail on that\nfateful day. Thus, on the grounds of negligence a suit was filed Chandra against the Government.\nThe suit will\nDecide\n(a)Succeed because there was gross negligence on part of the State.\n(b)Fail because maintain jail facilities is part of the sovereign function of the State.\n(c)Succeed because securing law and order is not a sovereign function of the State.\n(d)Fail because the State cannot be held responsible in any way if people lose life because of their\npersonal rivalries even in facilities maintained and operated by the State.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 303\n18. Legal Principle : Under Article 12, unless the context otherwise requires, \u201cthe State\u201d includes\u2014\n(a)the Government and Parliament of India;\n(b)the Government and Legislature of each of the States; and\n(c)all local or other authorities: (i) within the territory of India; or (ii) under the control of the\nGovernment of India.\nFactual Situation : Mr. Arvind is employed with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). He\nfaces discrimination at work at the hands of the Management and thinks that his right to equality\nis violated. He contemplates moving a writ petition against ONGC but his colleague suggests that\nMr. Arvind will not succeed because ONGC is not \u2018State\u2019.\nDecide\n(a)ONCG is \u2018State\u2019 as per Article 12 of the Constitution.\n(b)ONGC is not \u2018State\u2019 as per Article 12 of the Constitution.\n(c)Mr. Arvind will not succeed because a writ cannot be brought against a Company.\n(d)ONGC is not \u2018State\u2019 because its shares are listed in the stock market.\n19. Legal Principle  : No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force\nat the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence.\nFactual Situation : Ms. Chandni had an altercation with her classmate in her college and in the\nheat of the moment she hurled a racist abuse at her classmate and her classmate was deeply\noffended by it. Ms. Chandni had later apologized for it. In the next few months, a law was passed\nwhich made racist abuse punishable. Aware of the fact that the law of limitation does not apply to\ncriminal acts, she moved an application to the court to initiate criminal action against Ms. Chandni\nfor the racist abuse. The classmate\u2019s application will:\nDecide\n(a)Fail because racist abuse was not punishable when it was hurled.\n(b)Succeed because the law made racist abuse punishable with imprisonment and it is undeniable\nthat Ms. Chandni has hurled that abuse.\n(c)Succeed because law of limitation does not apply to criminal acts.\n(d)Fail because it was not a serious offence and Ms. Chandni had already apologized for it.\n20. Legal Principle : No person shall be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have\nbeen inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.\nFactual Situation : A person was accused of cheating and before he was arrested and committed\nto trial for it, the law relating to cheating was changed and the punishment for it was increased to\nlife imprisonment. The person was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. He decides\nto challenge his sentence of life imprisonment. He will\nDecide\n(a)Fail because the punishment for cheating was increased to life imprisonment before his trial\nbegan.\n(b)Succeed because the punishment for cheating was not life imprisonment when he committed\nit.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 304\n(c)Fail because the law does not provide for such leniency to guilty persons.\n(d)Succeed only if he is able to prove his innocence.\n21. Legal Principle : The right of all citizens to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation,\ntrade or business is a Fundamental Right.\nFactual Situation  : Due to a law passed by the Government, even a person with good knowledge\nof law cannot appear in the Court as lawyer unless he has a law degree from a recognized\nuniversity and fulfils other mandatory conditions. Due to this Mr. Dinesh is not able to appear in\ncourts and believes that government is denying him of his Fundamental Right to practice any\nprofession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. He decides to challenge this as a\nviolation of his Fundamental Right. He will\nDecide\n(a)Succeed because the requirements to be eligible to appear before the Court deny him the\nopportunity to earn his livelihood.\n(b)Succeed because government cannot abridge Fundamental Rights in any manner under\nany condition.\n(c)Fail because the Government is well within its rights to prescribe eligibility and other conditions\nfor profession, trade or business.\n(d)Fail because Government has the power to abrogate the Fundamental Rights.\n22. Legal Principle  : Article 14 of the Constitution says that \u201cthe State shall not deny to any person\nequality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India\u201d.\nFactual Situation  : Due to the growing menace of terrorism in the country, the Government of\nIndia decided to have a new substantive criminal laws for terrorists from other countries. A\nforeign terrorist captured by the police and subjected to the new law claimed that his rights\nunder Article 14 of the Indian constitution were violated. His claim will:\nDecide\n(a)Fail because the rights under Article 14 are available only to the citizens of India.\n(b)Fail because the rights under the Article cannot be made available to people who engage in\nterrorist activities in India.\n(c)Succeed because he is entitled to be subjected to the same laws as any other person charged\nwith the same offence.\n(d)Succeed because once he is captured by the Indian authorities, he acquired all the\nFundamental Rights that are enjoyed by the citizens of India.\n23. Legal Principle  : The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights\nconferred by Part III and if such a law is made, it shall be void to the extent to which it curtails  any\nsuch right.\nFactual Situation  : Right to Property was a Fundamental Right but was abolished as such by a\nConstitutional amendment. Mr. Gautam decides to challenge the constitutional validity of the\namendment. He will\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 305\nDecide\n(a)Succeed because the State cannot make any law which takes away or abridges the rights\nconferred by Part III.\n(b)Fail because \u2018law\u2019 referred to in the above statement does not apply to Constitutional\namendment Acts.\n(c)Succeed because even constitutional amendments cannot take away Part III rights.\n(d)Fail because Right to Property was not conferred by Part III.\n24. Legal Principle : All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties\ncompetent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object.\nFactual Situation : A was planning to sell his property to B but B was not aware of it. Since B was\ninterested in the property, he threatened to harm the only child of A if A did not enter into an\nagreement to sell the property to B. The price at which the agreement to sell was agreed upon\nwas much more than the expectation of A or the prevailing market price of the property. Once the\nagreement was signed, B got to know that A was anyway interested in selling the property to B\nand at a lower price. A later refused to execute the sale deed and claimed that the contract\nbetween the parties was not valid. A will:\nDecide:\n(a)Fail because there was a valid contract between him and B.\n(b)Succeed because the consent of A for the agreement to sell was not a free consent.\n(c)Fail because in the given facts and circumstances even with the free consent the same\ntransaction would have taken place. A is even better placed because he is receiving a higher\nprice.\n(d)Succeed because there is no lawful object in the contract.\n25. Legal Principle : A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may\nmake a contract when he is of sound mind.\nFactual Situation  : Mr. Jamal is a patient in a lunatic asylum who experiences intervals of sound\nmind. Jamal entered into a contract during such interval of sound mind. On having suffered\nlosses, he challenged the validity of the contract on the ground that he not only was mentally\nunsound but also lived in lunatic asylum.\nDecide\n(a)The contract is valid.\n(b)The contract is invalid.\n(c)The contract is voidable at the option of Mr. Jamal.\n(d)The contract is voidable at the option of the opposite party.\n***\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 306\nP ART B\nLOGICAL REASONING\n306\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 307\nLesson 6\nLOGICAL\nREASONING\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 308\n\u201cLogic takes care of itself; all we have to do is to look and see how it does it.\u201d - Ludwig Wittgens tein\nIntroduction\nLogical reasoning (or just \u201clogic\u201d for short) is one of the fundamental skills\nof effective thinking.\nIt works by raising questions like:\n\u2022If this is true, what else must be true?\n\u2022If this is true, what else is probably true?\n\u2022If this isn\u2019t true, what else can\u2019t be true?\nIn the contemporary perspective, Doyle Alison (2019), in his article \u2018The\nImportance of Logical Thinking in the Workplace\u20191  stated that Logical\nthinkers observe and analyze phenomena, reactions, and feedback and\nthen draw conclusions based on that input. They can justify their strategies,\nactions, and decisions based on the facts they gather.\nThese are all inferences: they\u2019re connections between a given sentence\n(the \u201cpremise\u201d) and some other sentence (the \u201cconclusion\u201d). Inferences\nare the basic building blocks of logical reasoning, and there are strict rules\ngoverning what counts as a valid inference and what doesn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s a lot\nlike math, but applied to sentences rather than numbers.2\nExample - 1 :\nIf there is someone at the door, the dog will bark.\nAssuming this sentence holds true, there are some other sentences that must also be true.\n\u2022If the dog didn\u2019t bark, there is no one at the door.\n\u2022Just because the dog barked doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s someone at the door.\nThere are also a few sentences that are probably true, such as:\n\u2022The dog can sense (hear or smell) when someone is at the door.\n\u2022The dog belongs to the people who live in the house where the door is located.\nExample - 2\nA sales representative modifies a presentation about a product to highlight its user-friendly qualit ies after\nLogical\nreasoningOne of the\nFundamental\nSkills\nEffective\nThinking\nLogical ThinkersObserve and AnalyzePhenomena\nReactions\nFeedbackThen draw\nconclusions based on\nthat input\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 309\nreceiving feedback from customers indicating that ease of use was the primary reason that they had\npurchased the product.\nLogical Reasoning: History and Significance\nThe word \u2018Logical Reasoning is made up of two words \u2013 Logical and Reasoning. So let us understand,\nanalyses and brief out the history of Logical Reasoning with the help of these two words separately as well\nas in conjunction.\nLogic: Milieu\nLogic is a universal part of the human experience. Even agriculture would be impossible without indu ctive\nreasoning about weather and sunlight, and construction would be impossible without mathematics and\ndeductive reasoning about what makes a structure sturdy.\nLogic (from the Greek \"logos\", which has a variety of meanings including word, thought, idea, argume nt,\naccount, reason or principle) is the study of reasoning, or the study of the principles and criteria  of valid\ninference and demonstration. It attempts to distinguish good reasoning from bad reasoning.\nFormalized logic has appeared in several places with more or less similar results. The Greek philoso pher\nAristotle is credited with being the first to develop a formal system of logical reasoning, but ther e were\nalready people in India and China working on formal logic long before Aristotle was born.3\nHistory of Logic: A Snapshot from Vedas to Contemporary Era4\nIn Ancient India, the \"Nasadiya Sukta\" of the Rig Veda  contains various logical divisions that were later\nrecast formally as the four circles of catuskoti: \"A\", \"not A\", \"A and not A\" and \"not A and not not  A\". The\nNyaya school of Indian philosophical speculation is based on texts known as the \"Nyaya Sutras\" of Ak sapada\nGautama from around the 2nd Century B.C., and its methodology of inference is based on a system of\nlogic (involving a combination of induction and deduction by moving from particular to particular vi a\ngenerality) that subsequently has been adopted by the majority of the other Indian schools.\nBut modern logic  descends mainly from the Ancient Greek tradition. Both Plato and Aristotle conceived\nof logic as the study of argument and from a concern with the correctness of argumentation. Aristotl e\nproduced six works on logic, known collectively as the \"Organon\", the first of these, the \"Prior Ana lytics\",\nbeing the first explicit work in formal logic.\nAristotle espoused two principles of great importance in logic, the Law of Excluded Middle\n(that every statement is either true or false) and the Law of Non-Contradiction (confusingly,\nalso known as the Law of Contradiction, that no statement is both true and false).\nHe is perhaps most famous for introducing the syllogism (or term logic) (see the section on Deductiv e\nLogic below). His followers, known as the Peripatetics, further refined his work on logic.\nIn medieval times , Aristotelian logic (or dialectics) was studied, along with grammar and rhetoric, as\none of the three main strands of the trivium, the foundation of a medieval liberal arts education.\nLogic in Islamic philosophy also contributed to the development of modern logic, especially the\ndevelopment of Avicennian logic (which was responsible for the introduction of the hypothetical syll ogism,\ntemporal logic, modal logic and inductive logic) as an alternative to Aristotelian logic.\nIn the 18th Century, Immanuel Kant  argued that logic should be conceived as the science of judgment,\nso that the valid inferences of logic follow from the structural features of judgments, although he still\nmaintained that Aristotle had essentially said everything there was to say about logic as a discipli ne.\nIn the 20th Century , however, the work of Gottlob Frege, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell\non Symbolic Logic, turned Kant's assertion on its head. This new logic, expounded in their joint wor k\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 310\n\"Principia Mathematica\", is much broader in scope than Aristotelian logic, and even contains classic al\nlogic within it, albeit as a minor part. It resembles a mathematical calculus and deals with the rel ations of\nsymbols to each other.\nAristotle defined logic as \"new and necessary reasoning\", \"new\" because it allows us to learn what w e do\nnot know, and \"necessary\" because its conclusions are inescapable. It asks questions like \"What is c orrect\nreasoning?\", \"What distinguishes a good argument from a bad one?\", \"How can we detect a fallacy in\nreasoning?\"\nThe Indian, Chinese, and Greek systems were all remarkably similar in their rules, which suggests th at\nthere may have been some mutual influence despite the distance. Traders and travelling scholars may\nhave brought ideas about logical reasoning with them all over the world, allowing for rapid developm ent\nof new ideas.\nLogic may seem like a stuffy, abstract discipline used only by philosophers and lawyers, but it has had a\nprofound influence on the history of science and technology as well. Alan Turing, the inventor of th e\nmodern computer, was a logician rather than a thinkerer or engineer, and his famous \u201cTuring Machine\u201d\nwas a product of his rigorous training in formal logical reasoning.\nNeed and Significance of Logic\nLogic investigates and classifies the structure of statements and arguments, both through the study of\nformal systems of inference and through the study of arguments in natural language. It deals only wi th\npropositions (declarative sentences, used to make an assertion, as opposed to questions, commands or\nsentences expressing wishes) that are capable of being true and false. It is not concerned with the\npsychological processes connected with thought, or with emotions, images and the like. It covers cor e\ntopics such as the study of fallacies and paradoxes, as well as specialized analysis of reasoning us ing\nprobability and arguments involving causality and argumentation theory.\nAncient India, the\n\"Nasadiya Sukta\" of\nthe Rig Veda\nModern Logic\ndescends mainly\nfrom the Ancient\nGreek tradition\nPlato and Aristotle -\nNew and Necessary\nReasoningMedieval times -\nAristotelian logic\nLogic in Islamic\nphilosophy\nIn the 18th Century\n- Science  of\nJudgementIn 20th Century -\nSymbolic Logic\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 311\nReasoning: Milieu\nAs per Merriam W ebster Dictionary, Reasoning means the use of reason especially, the drawing of infe rences\nor conclusions through the use of reason.\nReshma S in her writings on \u2018Reasoning: Meaning, Definition and Types\u2019, stated that reasoning is one  of\nthe best forms of controlled thinking consciously towards the solution of a problem. It is realistic  in the\nsense that the solution is sought always in reference to the reality of the situation. We can solve many\nproblems in our day-dreams, dreams and imaginations but they are unrealistic solutions.\nSherman defined, \u201creasoning is a process of thinking during which the individual is aware of a probl em\nidentifies, evaluates, and decides upon a solution\u201d.\nReasoning is used not only when we want to solve an immediate problem but also when we anticipate\nfuture problems.\nReasoning plays a significant role in one\u2019s adjustment to the environment. It not only determines on e\u2019s\ncognitive activities but also influences the behavior and personality.\nOther Definitions of Reasoning:\n1.\u201cReasoning is a stepwise thinking with a purpose or goal in mind\u201d \u2014 Garrett.\n2.\u201cReasoning is the term applied to highly purposeful, controlled and selective thinking\u201d \u2014\nGates.\n3.\u201cReasoning is the word used to describe the mental recognition of cause and effect\nrelationships, it may be the prediction of an event from an observed cause or the inference\nof a cause from an observed event\u201d\u2014 Skinner.\nThus reasoning is a highly specialized thinking which helps an individual to explore mentally the ca use\nand effect relationship of an event or solution of a problem by adopting some well-organized systema tic\nsteps based on previous experience combined with present observation.\nContent of Logic/Logic Systems/Logical Reasoning\nLogical systems should have three things: consistency (which means that none of the theorems of the\nsystem contradict one another); soundness (which means that the system's rules of proof will never a llow\na false inference from a true premise); and completeness (which means that there are no true sentenc es\nin the system that cannot, at least in principle, be proved in the system).\nPopular Use or Culture of Logical Reasoning: An Example\nOn Sherlock, the great detective Sherlock Holmes has a website called \u201cThe Art of Deduction,\u201d in whi ch\nhe explains his methods for solving crimes. However, the website has the wrong name \u2014 nearly all of\nSherlock\u2019s inferences are inductive rather than deductive. That is, they bring together bits and pie ces of\nevidence to develop a theory about what probably happened in a particular crime. They\u2019re not based o n\nthe kind of logical certainty that we saw in section 1, but rather on reasoning about likelihoods an d\nprobabilities. It\u2019s always logically possible that Sherlock could have it wrong, even though that ra rely\nseems to happen.\nTypes of Logical Reasoning\nThere are two basic types of logic, each defined by its own type of inference. They correspond to th e two\ncategories in the example from section 1.\n1.Deductive Reasoning  : It is the ability to draw some logical conclusions from known statements\n(premises) or evidences. Here one starts with already known or established generalized statement\nor principle and applies it to specific cases.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 312\nFor example, all human beings are mortal you are a human being, therefore, you are mortal.\nDeductive Reasoning is based on Deduction or Deductive Logic. Deduction is when the\nconclusion, based on the premises, must be true.\n\u2022For example, if it\u2019s true that the dog always barks when someone is at the door and it\u2019s true\nthat there\u2019s someone at the door, then it must be true that the dog will bark. Of course, the\nreal world is messy and doesn\u2019t always conform to the strictures of deductive reasoning\n(there are probably no actual dogs who always bark when someone\u2019s at the door), but\ndeductive reasoning is still important in fields like law, engineering, and science, where strict\ntruths still hold. All math is deductive.\n\u2022Another example of Deduction states that - An organization may work with a core belief that\nemployees are more productive if they have control over the ways they carry out their\nresponsibilities. A manager could demonstrate logical thinking using deductive reasoning by\nmeeting with subordinates, communicating department goals, and structuring a\nbrainstorming session for staff to decide methods for reaching those objectives.\n2.Inductive Reasoning  : It is a specialized thinking aimed at the discovery or construction of a\ngeneralized principle by making use of particular cases, special examples and identifying of element s\nor relations.\n\u2022For example, Mohan is mortal, Radha is mortal, Karim is mortal; therefore, all human beings\nare mortal.\nInductive Reasoning is based on Inductive logic. Inductive logic is when the conclusion, based\non the premises, is probably the answers are less definitive than they are in deductive reasoning,\nbut they are often more useful. Induction is our only way of predicting what will happen in the\nfuture: we look at the way things are, and the way they have been in the past, and we make an\neducated guess about what will probably happen. But all predictions are based on probability, not\ncertainty: for example, it\u2019s extremely probable that the sun will rise tomorrow morning. But it\u2019s no t\ncertain, since there are all sorts of catastrophes that could happen in between now and then.\nLogical Reasoning  vs. Critical Thinking\nLogic is one of the main pillars of critical thinking. And there\u2019s no question that critical thinkin g would be\nimpossible without some understanding of logical reasoning. However, there are many other skills inv olved\nin critical thinking, such as:\nTypes of Logical\nReasoning\nDeductive\nReasoningInductive\nReasoning\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 313\n\u2022Empathy , or the ability to imagine what someone else is feeling or experiencing. This is a crucial\nskill for critical thinking, since it allows you to broaden your perspective and reflect on your\nactions and beliefs. Empathy also makes you a better student of philosophy because it enables you\nto put yourself in the author\u2019s shoes and understand the argument from within.\n\u2022Analogy , or noticing similarities and thinking them through. Analogies allow us to draw conclusions\nabout, for example, the similarity between our own time and some moment in history, and thus try\nto make better decisions in the future. This skill is closely related to inductive logic.\n\u2022Creativity . Critical thinking is all about innovative problem-solving and coming up with new ideas,\nso it\u2019s heavily dependent on creativity. Just like a creative art, critical thinking depends on\nassembling old parts in new ways, working inventively within constraints, and matching moments\nof inspiration with hours of rigorous craft.\nLogic assists in establishing correlation between two variables, i.e., independent and dependent variables\npertaining to corporate activities.\nFor instance, through Karl Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient and Co-efficient of determination the\ncorrelation between two variables, i.e. CSR Expenditure and Goodwill may be observed\nSignificance of Logical Reasoning for Company Secretaries : Key Points\n\u2022From the perspective of Logic leads to conclusion by correlating different facts and statements.\n\u2022This correlation is done through the arguments.\n\u2022As a Company Secretaries, one has to resolve various issues in the day to day affair and also\nensure compliances and governance in true letter and spirit. This requires the professionals to\nargue or to support in favour of some conclusion with the help of certain facts and some\nassumptions.\n\u2022A Company Secretary does all these things throughout his life in imparting his professional\nexcellence.\n\u2022Therefore, Logical Reasoning is becoming more important day by day in the entrance test of\nprofessional as well as academic bodies.\nLogical Reasoning: A Summarized Guidance to CSSET Candidates\n\u2022Logic only ensures a valid conclusion.\n\u2022This conclusion may or may not be consistent with our usual experience. But the questions based\non logic are to be solved only as per information provided, without using one\u2019s own conscience.\n\u2022Therefore, conclusion should follow directly from the statements provided in question, and no\ndeviation from it is allowed.\n\u2022Questions on Logical Reasoning are of different types. You may be asked to derive an inference or\na conclusion from given statements. Sometimes, you have to consider a statement and decide\nfrom among given assumptions, which one is more implicit in the statement and which is not.\n\u2022You may have to weigh pros and cons of some arguments given for a statement.\n\u2022You will have to decide whether the argument is a strong argument or a weak argument.\nThe key to have a command over this Chapter is to practise as many questions as you can.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 314\nContents\nConsidering the vision and mission of the Institute along with aims and objectives of CSSET under th e\nperspectives of global requirement, the contents of Logical Reasoning are divided under three heads,\nwhich includes:\n1.Logical Reasoning\n2.Verbal Reasoning, and\n3.Non- V erbal Reasoning.\nThese heads are well facilitated with various topics and subtopics under them.

Therefore, 1minute space traverses an angle of 60\n\u2022In 1 hour, Minute hand traverses 60 minute space or 3600 , Hour hand traverses 5 minute space\nor 300\n\u2022The hands of the clock are perpendicular in 15 minute spaces apart\n\u2022The hands of the clock are in straight line and opposite to each other in 30 minute spaces apart.\n\u2022The hands of the clock are in straight line when they coincide or opposite to each other.\n\u2022The hands of the clock are perpendicular to each other for 22 times in 12 hours and for 44 times\nin a day.\n\u2022The hands of the clock are opposite to each other for 11 times in 12 hours and 22 times in a day.\n\u2022The hands of the clock coincides with each other for 11 times in 12 hours and 22 times per day\n\u2022The hands of the clock are 44 times in a straight line per day\n\u2022The minute hand gain 55 minutes over hour hand per hour.\n\u2022Hence x minute space to be gained by minute hand over hour hand can be calculated as x.(60/\n55) or x.(12/11)\nFor Example\nAt what time between 2'O clock and 3'O clock the hands of the clock are opposite to each other.\n1.34(6/11) past 2'Oclock\n2.43(7/11) past 2'Oclock\n3. 56 (8/11) past 2'Oclock\n4.64(9/11past 2'Oclock\nSolution\nAt 2'O clock the minute hand will be at 12 as shown:\n\u2022The minutes hand to coincide with the hour hand it should trace at first 10 minute spaces;\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 316\n\u2022And then the hands of the clocks to be opposite to each other minute hand should trace 30\nminute spaces i.e. totally it should gain 10+30=40 minute spaces to be opposite to that of hour\nhand\nWe know that,\n\u2022Minute hand gains 55 minute spaces over hour hand in 1 hour\nTherefore, Minute hand gain 40 minute spaces over hour hand in 40 \u00d7 (60/55) = 43(7/11)\nHence the hand of the clock will minutes be opposite to each at 43( 7/11 ) past 2'Oclock\nTherefore, correct option is 2'\nWhen clock is too fast, too slow\n\u2022If a clock or watch indicates 6 hr 10 min when the correct time is 6, it is said that the clock is 1 0 min\ntoo fast\n\u2022If it indicates 6. 40 when the correct time is 7, it is said to be 20 min too slow.\nNow let us have an example based on this concept.\nFor Example\nMy watch, which gains uniformly, is 2 minutes. I have to attend a show at noon on Sunday, and is\n4 min 48 seconds fast at 2 PM on the following Sunday. Find out  when was it correct ?\nSolution\nFrom Sunday noon to the following Sunday at 2 PM, there are 7 days 2 hours or 170 hours.\nThe watch gains 2+4 4/5 min in 170 hrs.\nTherefore, the watch gains 2 min in   2 (divided by) 6 4/5 (multiply by) 170 hrs i.e., 50 hours.\nNow 50 hours = 2 Days 2 Hrs.\nTherefore, 2 days 2 hours from Sunday noon = 2 PM on Tuesday.\nCalendar Concept\n\u2022The time in which the earth travels round the sun is a solar year and is equal to 365 days 5 hrs. 48\nminutes and 47 1/2 seconds\n\u2022Year is 365.2422 days approximately.\n\u2022The common year consists of 365 days.\n\u2022The difference between a common year and a solar year is therefore 0.2422 of a day and we\nconsider it by adding a whole day to every fourth year.\n\u2022Consequently in every 4th year there are 366 days.\n\u2022The years which have the extra day are called leap years. The day is inserted at the end of\nFebruary, The difference between 4 common years and 4 solar years is 0.969 of a day.\n\u2022If therefore, we add a whole day to every 4th year, we add too much by 0.0312 of a day. To take\naccount of this, we omit the extra day three times every 400 years,\n\u2022The thing is to ensure that each season may fall at the same time of the year in all years.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 317\n\u2022In course of time, without these corrections, we should have winter in July and summer in\nJanuary also.\nWith the very small variation, the present divisions of the year are those given in B.C 46 by Julius  Caesar.\nThe omission of the extra day three times in 400 years is called the Gregorian Correction. This corr ection\nwas adopted at once in 1582 in Roman Catholic Countries. But not in England until, 1752.\nThe Gregorian mode* of reckoning is called the New Style, the former, the Old Style.\nThe New Style has not yet been adopted in Russia, so that they are now 13 days behind us. For exampl e\n\u2013 \u2018What we call October 26th, they call that 13th October. They have Christmas day on 7th of January  and\nwe have on 25th December every year.\n\u2022In an ordinary year there are 365 days i.e., 52 weeks + 1 day\n\u2022Therefore an ordinary year contains 1 odd day.\nA leap year contains 2 odd days.\n100 year = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years.\n=76 odd days + 48 odd days\n=124 odd days = 17 weeks + 5 days. (in the consideration of weeks)\nTherefore, 100 years contain 5 odd days.\n200 years contains 3 odd days.\n300 years contain 1 odd days\n\u2022Since there are 5 odd days in 100 years, there will be 20 days in 400 years. But every 4th century\nis a leap year.\n\u2022Therefore, 400 years contain 21 days. Here 400 years contain no odd days.\n\u2022As First January 1 AD was Monday. One must count days from Sunday\ni.e. Sunday for 0 odd days, Monday for 1 odd day, and Tuesday for 2 odd days and so on.\n\u2022Last day of a century cannot be either Tuesday. Thursday or Saturday.\n\u2022The first day of a century must either be Monday. Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday.\nCalendar: Examples\nWe can clarify the concept of Calendars with following Examples\nExample -1\nHow many times does the 29th days of the month occur in 400 consecutive years\n(1)97 Times\n(2)4400 times\n(3) 4497 times\n(4) None\n* We have 1 possible answer for the clue as per the Mode of Reckoning dates according to Gregorian Cal endar\nwhich appears 1 time in our database.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 318\nSolution:\nIn 400 consecutive years there are 97 leap years. Hence in 400 consecutive years, February has the\n29th Days - 97 times, and the remaining 11 months have the 29th Day 400 x 11 or  4400 times.\nTherefore, 29th Day of the month occurs (4400 + 97) or 4497 times.\nExample \u2013 2\nGiven that on 10th November 1981 is Tuesday, what was the day on 10th November 1581\n(1)Monday\n(2)Thursday\n(3)Sunday\n(4)Tuesday\nSolution\nAfter every 400 years, the same day comes.\nThus if 10th November, 1981 was Tuesday, before 400 years i.e. on 10th November 1581, it has to be\nTuesday.\nImportant Formula and Equations\nSome important formulas and equations may help the candidates to solve the questions related to Cloc ks\nand Calendars are listed as below\n1.Minute Spaces : The face or dial of watch is a circle whose circumference is divided into 60\nequal parts, called minute spaces.\n2.Hour Hand and Minute Hand  : A clock has two hands, the smaller one is called the hour hand\nor short hand while the larger one is called minute hand or long hand.\nIn 60 minutes, the minute hand gains 55 minutes on the hour on the hour hand.\nIn every hour, both the hands coincide once.\nThe hands are in the same straight line when they are coincident or opposite to each\nother.\nWhen the two hands are at right angles, they are 15 minute spaces apart.\nWhen the hands are in opposite directions, they are 30 minute spaces apart.\nAngle traced by hour hand in 12 hrs = 360\u00b0\nAngle traced by minute hand in 60 min. = 360\u00b0.\nIf a watch or a clock indicates 8.15, when the correct time is 8, it is said to be 15 minutes too\nfast.\nOn the other hand, if it indicates 7.45, when the correct time is 8, it is said to be 15 minutes\ntoo slow.\n3.Odd Days : We are supposed to find the day of the week on a given date. For this, we use the\nconcept of 'odd days'. In a given period, the number of days more than the complete weeks are\ncalled odd days.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 319\n4.Leap Y ear:  (i) Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year, if it is not a century.  (ii) Every 4th century is\na leap year and no other century is a leap year.\n5.Ordinary Y ear : The year which is not a leap year is called an ordinary years. An ordinary year\nhas 365 days.\n6.Counting of Odd Days : 1 ordinary year = 365 days = (52 weeks + 1 day). 1 ordinary year has\n1 odd day.\n1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days) 1 leap year has 2 odd days.\n100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years\n= (76 x 1 + 24 x 2) odd days = 124 odd days.\n= (17 weeks) = 5 odd days.\nImportant Facts/Points to Remember:\nNumber of odd days in 100 years = 5\nNumber of odd days in 200 years = (5 x 2)= 3 odd days.\nNumber of odd days in 300 years = (5 x 3) = 1 odd day.\nNumber of odd days in 400 years = (5 x 4 + 1) = 0 odd day.\nSimilarly, each one of 800 years, 1200 years, 1600 years, 2000 years etc. has 0 odd days.\nDay of the Week Related to Odd Days (Assuming that 1AD January 1st is a Sunday):\nNo. of days: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nDay: Sun. Mon. Tues. W ed. Thurs. Fri. Sat.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 320\n1.What is the angle between the two hands of a clock when the time shown by the clock is 6.30 PM?\n(a)00\n(b)50\n(c)30\n(d)150\nExplanation  : q = 11/2 m \u2013 30h\n= 11/2 *30 - 30 *6\n= /165-180/ = 150\n2.At what time between 3 and 4 o\u2019clock will the minute hand and the hour hand are   on the same\nstraight line but facing opposite directions.\n(a)3:49\n(b)3:15\n(c)3:39 1/11\n(d)3:49 1/11\nExplanation : On straight line means 180 degree angle.\n180 = 11/2m- 30h\n180 = 11/2 m \u201330*3\n180 = 11/2m-90\n(180+90)2 = 11m\nm = 540/11 = 49 1/11\n3.By how many degrees does the minute hand move in the same time, in which the hour hand\nmove by 280?\n(a)168\n(b)336\n(c)196\n(d)376\nExplanation : 28*2*6 = 336\n4.At what time, between 3 o\u2019clock and 4 o\u2019clock, both the hour hand and minute hand coincide\neach other?\n(a)3:30\n(b)3:16 4/11Sample Questions\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 321\n(c)3:1611/4\n(d)3:16 7/11\nExplanation  : Coincide means 00 angle.\n0 =11/2m \u201330*3\n11m = 90*2 = 180\nm= 180/11 = 16 4/11\nSo time = 3 : 16 4/11\n5.How many degrees will the minute hand move, in the same time in which the second hand move\n4800?\n(a)60\n(b)90\n(c)40\n(d)80\nExplanation : Minute hand covers 480/60= 80\n6.How many years have 29 days in February from 2001 to 2100?\n(a)26\n(b)25\n(c)23\n(d)24\nExplanation : 100th year is not a leap year.

Here the students have to test whether the statements are\nrelated to each other or not. Read them and choose the best option that describes the relationship\nbetween them. These types of problems judge the reasoning and analytical power of the students. Ther efore,\nCandidates are advised to read the statements very well to arrive at a particular conclusion.\nExample\nStatement\nI.Everybody should work hard.\nII.The only way to achieve success is to work hard.\nA - Statement I is the reason and statement II is the response.\nB - Statement II is the reason and statement I is the response.\nC - Both the statements I and II are the not depended reasons.\nD - Both the statements I and II are the response of not depended reasons.\nE - Both the statements I and II are the response of some common reasons.\nHerein the Answer is Option A\nExplanation -\nIn the statement I, it told about a generic statement. Working hard can be taken as a reason but to\ndescribe it as a reason there should be some response. The response is shown in statement II that te lls\nthat through hard work one can achieve success. Hence it shows that, statement I is the reason and\nstatement II is the response.\nTypes of Statement\nType - I\nThese kinds of Statements are about those cases where there will be a direct reason and response typ e of\nstatement will be present in the question. The last example that we have discussed goes under this\ncategory. Now let\u2019s discuss another problem of the same kind.\nStatement\nI.Apple has vitamin D that helps in boosting immunity.\nII.Doctors advice to eat an apple every day.\nA - Statement I is the reason and statement II is the response.\nB - Statement II is the reason and statement I is the response.\nC - Both the statements I and II are the not depended reasons.\nD - Both the statements I and II are the response of not depended reasons.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 324\nE - Both the statements I and II are the response of some common reasons.\nAnswer - Option B\nExplanation  - Here we can clearly see the reason is statement II. This is a reason to describe its\nresponse, which is statement I that tells the necessity of consuming an apple every day.\nType - II\nHere we will discuss about those cases in which both the statements will be the response of some com mon\nreason. Let\u2019s analyze it with an example.\nStatement\nI.There has been a curfew in the city.\nII.24 hours police patrolling is going on in the city.\nA - Statement I is the reason and statement II is the response.\nB - Statement II is the reason and statement I is the response.\nC - Both the statements I and II are the not depended reasons.\nD - Both the statements I and II are the response of not depended reasons.\nE - Both the statements I and II are the response of some common reasons.\nAnswer  - Option E\nExplanation\nClearly both the statements are directing towards a common reason. To simply our thought\nprocess we can assume that for some common reason like Hindu \u2013Muslim riot must have been\nreason this type of situation.\nTypes - III\nSometimes the two statements are the response of some not depended reasons. Let\u2019s try to analyze thi s\nwith an example.\nStatement\nI.There has been a curfew in the city.\nII.Doctors advice to eat an apple every day.\nA - Statement I is the reason and statement II is the response.\nB - Statement II is the reason and statement I is the response.\nC - Both the statements I and II are the not depended reasons.\nD - Both the statements I and II are the response of not depended reasons.\nE - Both the statements I and II are the response of some common reasons.\nAnswer  - Option D\nExplanation\nWe can clearly analyze one thing that, eating apple and curfew are nowhere related to each\nother. Hence, they must be the response of not depended reasons.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 325\nTypes of Causes\nThere can be different causes in following categories:\n1.Immediate Cause  : This is the cause that has occurred most recently. Consider the example of\nsnowfall. Water is heated by the sun and it evaporates into the atmosphere. Once in the\natmosphere, it cools down to a very low temperature and precipitates as snow. There are a few\ncauses that have led to snowfall. The most immediate being the fact that the raindrops freeze in\nthe low temperatures of the atmosphere.\n2.Principal Cause : This is the main cause responsible for an event. The immediate cause may or\nmay not be the Principal cause.\n3.Independent Cause : This is the cause that is independent of the events. In other words, the\neffect and the cause may not have a direct relationship or any relationship at all.\nCause and Effect Reasoning: Possibilities\nThe question on cause and effect reasoning are mainly designed to decide on a candidate\u2019s ability to analyze\na pair of given statements and to correlate them in terms of cause and effect. Five possibilities ma y arise:\n1.The fact in the first statement is the effect of that mentioned in the second statement i.e. the\nsecond statement expresses the cause that leads to the condition mentioned in the first;\n2.The contents of the first statement form the direct cause of the result discussed in the second\nstatement;\n3.Both the statements express generalized results that may not be backed by any specific cause but\nmay influence certain other factors;\n4.Both the statements are independent and may be explained as effects of different independent\ncauses;\n5.The effects in both the given statements may be caused or triggered by a third unmentioned\nevent which may thus be called the common cause of the given events.\nDirections or Tips\nIn each of the following questions, two statements numbered I and II are given. There may be cause a nd\neffect relationship between the two statements. These two statements may be the effect of the same c ause\nor independent causes. These statements may be independent causes without having any relationship.\nRead both the statements in each question and mark your answer accordingly.\nGive answer (a) if statement I is the cause and statement II is its effect\nGive answer (b) if statement II is the cause and statement I is its effect\nGive answer (c) if both the statements I and II are independent causes\nGive answer (d) if both the statements I and II are effects of independent causes\nGive answer (e) if both the statements I and II are effects of some common cause.\nExample -1\nI.The local traders' association urged all its members to close down their shops for a day to protest\nagainst the government's new tax policy.\nII.Many shopkeepers decided to close down their shops for the day and gave a day off to their\nemployees.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 326\nSolution\nClearly, the association's decision to go for a 'bandh' on a massive scale to protest against the go vernment's\nnew policy would have instigated the shopkeepers to keep their shops closed. Thus, I mentions the di rect\ncause of the effect in II. Hence the answer is (a).\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 327\nDirections : In each of the following questions, two statements numbered I and II are given. There may be\ncause and effect relationship between the two statements. These two statements may be the effect of the\nsame cause or independent causes. These statements may be independent causes without having any\nrelationship. Read both the statements in each question and mark your answer accordingly.\nGive answer (a) if statement I is the cause and statement II is its effect;\nGive answer (b) if statement II is the cause and statement I is its effect;\nGive answer (c) if both the statements I and II are independent causes;\nGive answer (d) if both the statements I and II are effects of independent causes;\nGive answer (e) if both the statements I and II are effects of some common cause.\nQ.1.\nI.The prices of vegetables have been increased considerably during this summer.\nII.There is tremendous increase in the temperature during this summer thereby damaging crops\ngreatly.\nAnswer B\nSolution\nClearly, damage to crops due to high temperature may have resulted in a short supply of vegetables\nand hence an increase in their prices\nQ.2\nI.Police resorted to lathi to disperse the unlawful gathering of large number of people.\nII.The citizens' forum called a general strike in protest against the police atrocities.\nAnswer A\nSolution\nClearly, the people's mass protest against the police might have instigated the latter to indulge in  lathi-\ncharge to disperse the mob.\nQ.3\nI.It is the aim of the city's civic authority to get air pollution reduced by 20% in the next two mont hs.\nIl.The number of asthma cases in the city is constantly increasing.\nAnswer B\nSolution\nThe increase in number of asthma cases must have alerted the authorities to take action to control a ir\npollution that triggers the disease.Sample Questions\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 328\nQ.4\nI.The police authority has recently caught a group of house breakers.\nII.The citizens group in the locality have started night vigil in the area.\nAnswer E\nSolution\nBoth the statements are clearly backed by a common cause, which is clearly and increase in the\nnumber of thefts in the locality.\nQ.5\nI.The university authority has instructed all the colleges under its jurisdiction to ban use of all\nphones inside the college premises.\nII.Majority of the teachers of the colleges signed a joint petition to the university complaining the\ndisturbances caused by cell phone ring-tones inside the classroom.\nAnswer B\nSolution\nClearly, the university's decision came as a sequel to the complaint received by it from the college\nteachers against use of mobile phones in the college premises.\nQ.6\nI.The government has recently fixed the fees for professional courses offered by the unaided\ninstitutions which are much lower than the fees charged last year.\nII.The parents of the aspiring students launched a severe agitation last year protesting against the\nhigh fees charged by the unaided institutions.\nAnswer B\nSolution\nThe parents' protest against high fees being charged by the institutional led the government to inte rfere\nand fix the fees at a more affordable level.\nQ.7.\nI.Large number of people living in the low-lying areas have been evacuated during the last few\ndays to safer places.\nIl.The Government has rushed in relief supplies to the people living in the areas.\nAnswer E\nSolution\nEvacuating low-lying areas and rushing in relief to the affected areas clearly that floods have occu rred\nin the area.\nQ.8.\nI.The performance of most of the students in final exam of class X in the by the Government was\nexcellent.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 329\nII.Many teachers of the Government schools left the school and joined private school.\nAnswer D\nSolution\nThe students of government schools performing well in the examinations and the teacher of\ngovernment schools leaving their jobs to join private school are two separate situations that must\nhave been triggered by independent causes.\nQ.9.\nI.Majority of the citizens in the locality belong to higher income group.\nII.The sales in the local supermarket are comparatively much higher than in other localities.\nAnswer B\nSolution\nThe comparatively higher sales in a particular locality are indicative of the high paying capacity o f the\nresidents of that locality.\nQ.10.\nI.There is considerable reduction in the number of people affected by water-borne disease in City\nA during this rainy season.\nII.The government has opened four new civil hospitals in City A in the beginning of the year.\nAnswer C\nSolution\nThe given statements are self-sufficient and depict independent events.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 330\nTopic 4\nCoding and Decoding\nCoding is a system of signals. This is a method of transmitting information in the form of codes or signals\nwithout it being known by a third person.\nThe person who transmits the code or signal, is called the sender and the person who receives it, is  called\nthe receiver. Transmitted codes or signals are decoded on the other side by the receiver\u2014this is kno wn\nas decoding.\nIn questions on coding-decoding, a word (basic word) is coded in a particular way and the candidates\nare asked to code other word in the same way.

The World Health Organization has called for improved surveillance to combat dengue and\nsays the outbreak can be controlled in two weeks if all necessary steps are taken to stop the mosqui toes\nfrom breeding and break the transmission cycle.\nDengue is already the most widespread mosquito-borne disease among humans. In the past 15 years,\noutbreaks in South and South-East Asia have been rapidly rising mostly due to falling environmental and\npublic health standards during urbanization. WHO, reports that severe forms of the disease such as\nhemorrhagic fever (DHF) and shock syndrome (DSS) are putting more 2.5 million people at risk worldwi de\neach year. Importantly, 95 % of the DHF cases are among children less than 15 years. Therefore, the\ndisease has major impacts on public health and future generations.\n1.If rate of urbanization in South Asia is controlled, outbreaks of all disease are reduced.\n2.World Health Organization has not collected data of outbreak of dengue in the past.\n3.There was no outbreak of dengue in the European countries in the recent past.\n4.Over the last decade, South Asian countries have not successfully stepped up mechanism to\ncombat dengue.\n5.DSS type dengue seems mostly to be affecting the adults.\nSolution\n1.It is mentioned in the passage that 'outbreaks in South and South East Asia have been rapidly\nrising mostly due to falling environmental and public health standards during urbanization'.\nThus, the fact in the question is quite probable. So, the conclusion is probably true.\n2.The passage talks of outbreak of dengue during the past 15 years. This contradicts give European\ncountries. Hence, the data are inadequate\n3.The passage mentions the outbreak of dengue during in Asian countries only and not the\nEuropean countries. Hence the data are inadequate\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 337\n4.It is mentioned in the passage that cases of outbreak of dengue are rapidly rising in South Asian\ncountries since the last 15 years. This means that adequate steps to combat dengue have not\nbeen taken. Hence, the conclusion is definitely true.\n5.Nothing about the effect of DSS type dengue is mentioned in the passage. Hence the data are\ninadequate.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 338\nDirections : Read the following passage and examine each inference given below it in the context of this\npassage.\nMark your answer as:\n(a)if the inference is 'definitely true'\n(b) if the inference is 'probably true';\n(c)if the 'data provided is inadequate';\n(d)if the inference is 'probably false'; and\n(e)if the inference is 'definitely false'.\nProcurement of wheat is in full swing in the north-western states of India. By June end, public agen cies are\nlikely to end up with food grain stocks of about 40 to 42 million tonnes, the highest ever witnessed  in the\nhistory of this country. This stock should be more than sufficient to ensure that the country's \"foo d\nsecurity\" is not endangered even if India faces two consecutive droughts.\nBut strangely enough, while the granaries overflow, there is still widespread hunger in the country even\nwithout a drought. The estimates of poverty are being debated, but broadly one-third of India seems to\nremain underfed. And this coexistent of grain surpluses with large scale hunger should make any seri ous\npolicy-maker think and examine the existing policy mix with a view to ensure faster economic growth and\nreduction in poverty.\nQ.1 The policy-makers in India are unaware of prevalent hunger.\nAnswer B\nExplanation\nThe statement \u2018\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. while the granaries overflow , there is still widespread hunger in the\ncountry ....' in the passage, indicates a lackening on the part of the policy-makers. Hence, it is\nquite probable that they are unaware of the prevalent hunger. Thus, the given inference is\nprobably true.\nQ.2 India always maintains foodgrain stocks to withstand two consecutive droughts.\nAnswer D\nExplanation\nIt is mentioned in the passage that the current foodgrain stock is the highest e witnessed in the\nhistory of this country'. Thus, it is quite probable that such stocks are not always maintained.\nHence, the given inference is probably false.\nQ.3 The distribution of foodgrains to the masses has remained a problem area for India.\nAnswer ASample Questions\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 339\nExplanation\nThe phrase 'coexistence of grain surpluses with large scale hunger' in the passage clearly implies\nthe given fact. Hence, the inference is definitely true.\nQ.4 India's foodgrains stock has been satisfactory over the past few years.\nAnswer C\nExplanation\nNothing about the previous years' foodgrain stock of the country has been mentioned in the\npassage. Only the current situation has been discussed. Hence, the data are inadequate.\nQ.5 More than 30 percent of the population in India do not even get two times meals per day.\nAnswer A\nExplanation\nThe given fact is clear from the sentence, \u201c.... but broadly one-third of India seems to remain\nunderfed\". Hence, the inference is definitely true.\nQ.6 The policy of India needs to be revamped to reduce the extent of poverty in the country.\nAnswer A\nExplanation\nThe last sentence of the passage clearly implies the given fact. Hence, the given inference is\ndefinitely true.\nQ.7 India, at present, is one of the countries in the world to have sufficient food for its people.\nAnswer A\nExplanation\nThe statement \u201cThis stock should be more than sufficient to ensure that country\u2019s food security\nis not endangered\u2019\u2019 clearly supports the given inference. Hence, the given inference is definitely\ntrue.\nDirection for [Question No: 8 To 10]: Economic liberalization and globalization have put pressures\non Indian industry, particularly on the service sector, to offer quality products and services at\nlow costs and with high speed.

I. Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action (2nd ed.) p. 41\nInferences are evidence-based guesses. They are the conclusions a reader draws about the unsaid\nbased on what is actually said. Inferences drawn while reading are much like inferences drawn in\neveryday life. If your best friend comes in from a blind date and looks utterly miserable, you would\nprobably infer the date was not a success. Drawing inferences while you read requires exactly the\nsame willingness to look at the evidence and come to a conclusion that has not been expressed in\nwords. Only in reading, the evidence for your inference consists solely of words rather than actual\nevents, expressions, or gestures.\nTo pull meaning from the page, readers need to draw all kinds of inferences. They need to infer main\nideas; figure out how sentences and paragraphs relate; connect supporting details to main ideas;\nmatch pronouns to antecedents (the words to which pronouns refer); understand the function of\nallusions (references to people and events that are used to make a point); and determine how visual\naids contribute to the author's message (This is just a partial list). While it's commonly assumed t hat\nwriters supply every word readers need to construct meaning, nothing could be further from the\ntruth. Readers almost always help create the texts they read. Those readers who don't draw inference s\nto fill in gaps in the text are likely to miss or misunderstand the meaning intended by the author.\nFor an illustration of how important inferences are to communication between reader and writer,\nread the following sentence: \"After reading that Paris Hilton told an interviewer how the beauty of her\nhit song 'Stars Are Blind' made her want to cry, I couldn't help thinking of a quotation from Mark\nTwain: 'Man is the only animal that blushes\u2014or needs to.' \" To understand that sentence, readers\nneed to draw at least three essential inferences:\na.The author thinks the song is just awful.\nb.Mark Twain thought that only humans blushed because they were the only ones who did\nthings they needed to be ashamed of.\nc.The author makes a connection between Hilton and Twain because she thinks Paris Hilton is\none of those humans who should blush from shame.\nNote as well how the author expects readers to infer that the antecedent for the pronoun \"her\" is Pa ris\nHilton. Linking pronouns to antecedents is one of the most common kinds of inferences readers are\nexpected to draw on a consistent basis.\nWhat You Need to Know About Inferences\n1.There are logical and illogical inferences, inferences that \"fit\" the rest of the text and inference s\nthat don't. Make sure your inference has the right fit by relying on the author's words more\nthan on your own feelings and opinions. To give you an obvious example: If the writer uses\nglowing language to describe the presidency of Bill Clinton but never states an opinion of the\nClinton years in office, you probably shouldn't infer that the writer is a Clinton critic just\nbecause you yourself thought Bill Clinton was a terrible president.\n2.Think of inferring implied main ideas as a two-step process, moving from part to whole. Your\nfirst step is to understand what each sentence contributes to your knowledge of the topic.\nNext ask yourself what the sentences combine as group to suggest. The answer to that question\nis the implied main idea of the paragraph.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 342\n3.If you draw an inference about the main idea, check to see if the your inference is contradicted\nby any statements in the paragraph. If it is, you have probably drawn an illogical inference, one\nthat does not follow from the information given. With particularly difficult readings, see if you ca n\nactually identify the language or statements that led you to the main idea you inferred. This kind\nof close reading is a great inference check. It also gives you practice doing the kind of thoughtful\nreading that guarantees remembering.\n4.Transitions such as \"consequently,\" \"next,\" and \"in summary\" definitely help readers make\nconnections between sentences and paragraphs. Transitions are the considerate author's way of\nsaying, \"This is the connection you need to make between what you just read and what's coming\nup.\" However, transitions are not as commonly used as readers might like. It's often the reader's\njob to supply sentence and paragraph connections. In other words, it's the reader's job to draw\nthe right inference. If a sentence doesn't open with a transition\u2014and a good many won't\u2014make\nsure you know how the sentence you are reading connects to the ideas that came before.\n5.Pay especially close attention to sentence openers. That's where you will often get the clues you\nneed to infer relationships between sentences and paragraphs.\n6.Be on the look-out for key allusions or idioms (expressions that might seem completely out of\nplace to those just learning the language, but which make sense to those who grew up hearing or\nreading these expressions), e.g., she loved her job; the money was \"icing on the cake\"). Allusions\nand idioms often suggest meanings that are central to the author's message. For instance, if the\nwriter says that \"the shotgun marriage between the unions and management dissolved once the\nwar was over\" you can infer that the unions and management were working together because\nthey were forced to by necessity. However, the writer doesn't say anything about either side being\nforced by necessity. Instead, she uses an idiom and expects reader to draw the correct inference.\n7.If the text includes visual aids, but neither the title nor caption tells you exactly how they relat e to\nthe author's meaning, take the time to figure out the relationship between text and graphic.\nInferring relationships between the author's words and the visual aids will deepen your overall\nunderstanding of the point or points being made. You will also have two ways, one verbal, one\nvisual, to anchor information in long-term memory.\n8.To get you started thinking about inferences, here are a few warm-up exercises. If you sail through\nthese, you can find more at Online Practice for Reading for Results.\nExercise 1\nDirections : Each item in this exercise describes a famous person. It's your job to infer the name of the\nperson described.\n1.A small-town lawyer from Illinois, tall and lanky with an Adam's apple that could have gone down\nin the Guinness Book of Records had it existed in the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, he\nchanged the face of American history, steering it through a civil war that left both sides bloody.\nWho knows what more he could have done had an assassin's bullet not cut him down.\nThe person described is _______________________________\nIn drawing the correct inference, which piece of information is more useful:\na.He had a big Adam's apple.\nb.He steered the nation through a civil war.\nAnswer and Explanation:\n1.Abraham Lincoln\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 343\nClue : He steered the country through civil war.\nExplanation  : Lots of people have big Adam\u2019s apples, but America has had only one civil war.\n2.Glittering and shaking to the strains of \"Proud Mary,\" this lady ruled the stage in the sixties, but\nIke ruled the roost until she walked out the door. It took her almost a decade to get back on\ntop but she still remains one of pop's great divas. Closing in on sixty, she can still belt out rock\nand roll with singers half her age, and \"Simply the Best\" just may qualify as her own personal\ntheme song.\nThe person described is _____________________________\nIn drawing the appropriate inference, which piece of information is more useful.\na.She ruled the stage but Ike ruled the roost.\nb.She was a popular singer in the sixties.\nAnswer and Explanation\nTina Turner\nClue : She ruled the stage but Ike ruled the roost.\nExplanation  : There were many popular women singers in the sixties but only one was linked\nto a domineering husband named Ike.\nExercise 2\nDirections  : For each situation, draw what you think is an appropriate inference.\n1.You have just gotten a pit bull puppy from an animal shelter. He's lovable but nervous. If you raise\nyour voice for any reason, he cowers and trembles. If you scold him, he hides. When you got him\nfrom the shelter, he had a slight limp and a deep scratch across his nose.\nInference  :\n2.You are a high school student sitting in class when a substitute teacher walks in and announces\nthat your regular teacher is ill. Everyone in the class including you erupts in applause. The\nsubstitute raps his knuckles on the desk for order, but the students ignore him and talk louder.\nInference : Answers may vary.\n1.Inference: The puppy may well have been abused by its former owners.\n2.Inference: The students are going to take advantage of the substitute teacher.\nExercise 3\nDirections : Each item in this exercise introduces a topic. Six specific statements about the topic follow.\nRead them carefully. Then choose the more appropriate inference.\n1.Topic: Shakespeare in nineteenth-century America\nSpecific Statements  :\na.In the early nineteenth century, Shakespeare was the most widely performed playwright in\nboth the North and Southeast.\nb.In the first half of the nineteenth century, English and American actors could always earn\nmoney by performing Shakespeare in towns both big and small.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 344\nc.American audiences were famous for their participation in performances of Shakespeare's\nplays: They hurled eggs and tomatoes at the villains and cheered and whistled for the heroes.\nd.By the end of the nineteenth century, theater owners claimed that most ordinary people\ncouldn't understand Shakespeare, and they were refusing to stage his plays.\ne.In the early 1800s, theater goers in big cities could often choose between three different\nproductions of Macbeth or Romeo and Juliet; by the end of the nineteenth century, it was\nhard to find one production of a Shakespeare play, let alone several.\nAnswer B\nInference\na.Early American audiences embraced Shakespeare's plays enthusiastically because they wanted\nto prove that they were as clever and sophisticated as their former British rulers.\nb.The role of Shakespeare in America changed dramatically as the nineteenth century drew to\na close.\n2.Topic  : The medics in World War II\nSpecific Statements\na.During training for combat, the medics were often despised because most of them had\nrefused to take up arms.\nb.The medics had their own barracks and were separated from combat soldiers, who referred\nto them as \"pill pushers\" and laughed at their medical drills.\nc.In actual combat, it was often the medics who meant the difference between life and death\nfor soldiers wounded in battle; they were the ones who braved gunfire to carry wounded\nsoldiers to the hospital.\nd.In many divisions, soldiers who had lived through combat took up collections in order to\nprovide bonuses for the medics.\ne.Interviewing veterans of World War II, author Stephen Ambrose consistently heard from\nmen who believed they owed their lives to some member of the medical core.\nInference\na.The combat experience profoundly changed the way soldiers felt about the medical core.\nb.Despite their bravery in the battles of World War II, medics never really received the respect\nthat was due them.\nAnswer A\nExercise 4\nDirections : Read each paragraph. Then choose the inference that could effectively sum up the main\nidea.\n1.When World War II broke out in Europe in 1939, the United States was the only major power\nwithout a propaganda agency. More important, despite prodding from England and France, the\nU.S. had no plans to create one. During World War I, a government-based group known as the\nCommittee for Public Information had successfully stirred up public feeling against German-\nAmericans because America was at war with Germany. As a result, many innocent German-\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 345\nAmerican citizens had been insulted, beaten, even lynched. In addition, a good portion of the\nAmerican public still believed that the United States had been tricked into entering World War I\nbecause of British propaganda. Distrustful of propaganda in general, there was little widespread\nsupport for a government agency dispensing it when the Second World War broke out.\nInference\na.Because of what had happened during World War I, the American public was suspicious of\npropaganda and not inclined to support its use when World War II first erupted.\nb.Aware of how the German government was using propaganda to spread hate and violence,\nthe American public was reluctant to make use of it at the beginning of World War II.\nAnswer A\n2.At his death in 1971, trumpeter Louis Armstrong was much loved as a celebrity. Yet as a musician,\nhe no longer commanded wide respect among the general public. To most people, he was the\nman with the toothy smile who made occasional appearances in television and movies usually\nsinging what had become his signature songs \"Hello, Dolly\" and \"It's a Wonderful World.\" Jazz\nenthusiasts, however, had another take on the passing of Louis Armstrong. To them he was the\nNew Orleans-born musician who had, along with Bix Beiderbecke, introduced the solo to jazz.\nWith records like \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue,\" \"I'm not Rough,\" and \"Potato Head Blues,\" Louis\nbecame the first great jazz influence. As music critic Terry Teachout has written, Louis Armstrong\nwas \"the player other players copied.\" Still, at his death, few really knew what Louis had\naccomplished. In his honor, radio and television broadcasts played \"Hello Dolly,\" not \"West-End\nBlues,\" his 1928 recording that starts off with what may be the most famous horn solo in jazz.\nInference\na.A hero to much of the jazz community, Louis Armstrong was forgotten by the general public\nat the time he died.\nb.At his death, Louis Armstrong was a beloved celebrity whose spectacular achievements had\nbeen forgotten by all but devoted jazz fans.\nAnswer B\nExercise 5\nDirections : Read each paragraph. Then draw an inference that sums up the main idea.\n1.In the movies, England's King Richard the First\u2014he of the lion heart and Robin Hood fame\u2014is a\nhero of spotless reputation. In Hollywood's many versions of the Robin Hood story, for example,\nRobin worships good King Richard and would willingly die for him. History, however, offers a\ndifferent slant on Richard's supposed goodness. In 1189, the Pope called for yet another crusade\nto take back the holy land of Jerusalem from Moslem rule. Intent on following the Pope's order,\nRichard combined forces with King Philip the II of France. Together, they managed to take the\ntown of Acre, a port on what is now Israel's Northwestern coast. Attempting to blackmail the\nMoslem ruler Saladin into giving up sacred lands, Richard took 2,500 civilians hostage, many of\nthem women and children. When Saladin refused, Richard promptly slaughtered every last one\nof his hostages.\nInference :\n2.When Bonnie Parker met Clyde Barrow, she was twenty years old. Although she had been a\nrebellious child and teenager, she had never broken a law in her life. The worst thing she had\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 346\ndone in her mother's opinion was run off and get married to a shiftless womanizer who humiliated\nand neglected her. When Clyde came along, Bonnie was ripe for the attentions of a man who\nseemed to think she was both important and attractive. As long as he didn't desert her, Bonnie\ndidn't much care about Clyde's two-year jail sentence. In jail at least, she knew where he was, and\nshe could write him daily letters about how much she loved him. Bonnie, however, got nervous\nwhen she heard that Clyde was planning a jailbreak. To bind him more tightly to her, she smuggled\nhim a gun and helped him escape. After he got caught and sent back to prison, Bonnie was even\nmore determined to wait for the man she called her \"one true love.\" Upon his release from jail,\nBonnie took Clyde home to meet her folks and announced she was going to Houston, Texas to\nget a new job. The next time her mother heard from her, Bonnie Parker was sitting in jail and had\nformally started her career as one half of the most famous bandit duo in history.\nAnswers will vary.\n1.Richard the Lionhearted was not as pure of heart as some movies suggest.\n2.Her romantic attachment to Clyde Barrow led Bonnie Parker into a life of crime.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 347\nTopic 7\nNumber Test\nSelf \u2013 Exercise Questions\nDirections to Solve\nIn each series, look for the degree and direction of change between the numbers.

In this category of questions, a se ries of\nvarious numbers is given with a blank. We are supposed to find out a pattern between every number an d\nits predecessor and find out the answer using the same logic.\nFor the purpose of better understanding of the concept, we classify them into the following categori es:\n\u2022Series with a constant difference\n\u2022Series with an increasing difference\n\u2022Series with a decreasing difference\n\u2022Squares/ Cubes series\n\u2022Combination of different operations\n\u2022Miscellaneous\nThe Best Approach\nThe best way of approaching number series questions is to observe the difference between various ter ms.\nIf we see a constant difference, then it\u2019s a constant difference series. If the difference is decrea sing or\nincreasing by a constant number, then it is a series of type 2 or type 3. But if there is no such in crease or\ndecrease in the difference, then try dividing the 2nd term with the first, third with the second and  so on.\nIf you obtain the same number each time, then it is a product series.\nAlso, if none of these seem to work, then you can try writing each term as a product of two factors and try\nto see if there is any pattern. If you still observe no pattern and the difference is increasing or decreasing\nrapidly, then try to look for square/ cube series.\nIf the difference is increasing and decreasing in some fixed manner, then it is a type of combinatio n series.\nLet us look at each type of series in greater depth:\n1.Series with a constant difference\nIn this kind of series, any 2 consecutive numbers have the same difference between them.\nFor example  : 1, 5, 9, 13, ?\nWe can observe that we are adding 4 to the previous number to obtain the next number. So,\nanswer here will be 13+4 = 17.\n2.Series with an increasing difference\nIn this type of series, the difference between two consecutive terms keep on increasing as we\nmove forward in a series. Let us try to use this theory in a question.\n1,2,4,7,11,16,?\nWe can clearly observe that the series is increasing with the difference: +1, +2, +3 ,+4 , +5.\nSo, we will obtain our number by adding 6 to 16 which gives us 22.\n3.Series with a decreasing difference\nIn this type of series, the difference between two consecutive terms keep on decreasing as we\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 351\nmove forward in a series. Let us try to use this with some modification in the previous question\nthat we did.\n16,11,7,4,2, ?\nWe can clearly observe that the series is decreasing with the difference: -5, -4, -3 ,-2 .\nSo, we will obtain our number by subtracting 1 from 2 which gives us 1.\n4.Squares/ Cubes series\nWe can have series where the terms are related to the squares/ cubes of numbers. We can have\na lot of variations here. Let us look at some of the possibilities.\n1, 9, 25, 49 , ?\nWe can observe that the above series is square of odd numbers starting from one. So our answer\nwill be 9^2 = 81.\nLet us look at another example:\n1 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 3 , 9 , 4 , ?\nWe observe here that the series is formed by writing numbers starting from 1 along with its square\nas the next number i.e. ( 1 , 1x1) , (2, 2x2) and so on. So we obtain our answer as 16 which is 4x2.\nConsider the following question:\n9 , 28 , ? , 126.\nThe answer for above question will be 65, let us discuss how.\n9 ,  28   ,     ?     ,    126.\n(23+1)  (33+1)                 (53+1)\nThe blank should have 43+1. Hence, the answer is 65 .\n5.Combination of different operations\nThis kind of series has more than 1 type of arithmetic operations which have been performed or\nit can also have 2 different series which have been combined to form a single series. This kind of\nseries is the most asked and the most important among all the types of series that we have\ndiscussed so far.\nConsider the series:\n1, 3 , 6 , 2 , 6 , 9 , 3 , 9 , ?\nThe first term 1 is multiplied by 3 to give the second term, 3 has been added to the second term to\nget the third term. The next term is 2 which is 1 more than the 1st term. It is multiplied with 3 to\ngive next term and the process is continued. With this process, we obtain our answer as 12.\nConsider the series:\n6, 10 , 7, 11 , 8 , 12 , ?\nWe can see that the above series is a combination of 2 simple series:\n1st, 3rd, 5th terms make an increasing series of 6 , 7 , 8\u2026.. . The 2nd, 4th and 7th term make a ser ies\nof 10, 11, 12\u2026. So, our answer will be 9 which is the 7th term of the original series.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 352\n6.Miscellaneous series\nSome series do not come under any of the above mentioned categories but are very important\nand also asked in many examinations.\nThe series of prime numbers or any other related operation done on it comes under this category.\nConsider the example:\n9, 25 , 49 , 121 , ?\nThe above series is the squares of prime numbers. So next term will be square of 13 which is 169.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 353\nTopic 9\nStatement and Assumptions\nLogical Reasoning (LR) is an integral part of Competitive Exams. It is designed to measure a person\u2019 s ability\nto draw logical conclusions based on statements or arguments, and to identify the strengths and weak nesses\nof those arguments. It is important to keep in mind that the statements and assumptions in logical r easoning\nmight defy your expectations rooted in the real world,\nFor instance, eating a lot makes you lose weight.\nRahul has lost weight.\nRahul eats a lot.\nThis goes against the knowledge that eating a lot leads to obesity, but within the limits of logical  reasoning,\nthis is a valid argument.\nStatements, Premises, Assumptions, Conclusion are some of the terms associated with logical reasonin g\nand you will be tested on these in IIFT, CAT, XAT, NMAT and MAT Exams.\n1.Statement\nIn logic, a statement is either a meaningful declarative sentence that is either true or false, or t hat\nwhich a true or false declarative sentence asserts. For instance,\n\u2018Socrates is a mortal\u2019, \u2018Delhi is the capital of India.\u2019\nA statement is different from a sentence. A sentence is one form of a statement, whereas there\nmay be several ways of formulating the same statement. For instance,\n\u2018All men are mortal\u2019\n\u2018Every man is mortal\u2019,\nare two different sentences that form the same statement.\n2.Assumption\nAn assumption is an unstated premise that supports the conclusion. Both premise and assumption\nare unquestionable facts but the assumption, unlike the premise, is not explicitly stated and needs\nto be deciphered. Assumption is something that is taken for granted in the context of a statement.\nFor instance, \u2018 All kids are happy when they get new gadgets. Vicky will be thrilled when he gets the\nnew mobile phone.\u2019 In this, the assumption is that Vicky is a kid. Without this assumption, the\nargument will make no sense.\n3.Statement- Assumption\nQuestions with statements and assumptions are common in the logical reasoning section of\nentrance examinations such as, CAT, IIFT, XAT, MAT and NMAT. Most questions on Statement and\nAssumptions include a statement followed by further statements, which have to be tested for\nwhether they are implied in the given statement or not. For instance:\nStatement- A big retail store was attacked by vegetable vendors in Amritsar.\nAssumptions  -  i.The store has affected the livelihood of local vegetable vendors.\nii.The store is built in thickly populated areas.\nConsider the statement and decide which of the given assumption is implicit.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 354\nThe answer to this will be the first assumption, because the store is affecting the vendors, which\ncauses the attack. Assumption ii is irrelevant because nothing is mentioned regarding the location\nof the store.\nb.Statement - \u201cPlease switch off the mobile phones while you are in the theatre\u201d, a notice outside a\ntheatre.\nAssumption - i.Every viewer who enters the theatre keeps mobile phones.\nii.Switched on mobile phones might distract the performers.\nIn this, assumption ii is implied by the given statement.\nStatement and assumptions are crucial concepts to understand thoroughly, for doing well in the\nlogical reasoning section.\nRules\n\u2022Assumption is always Indefinite & Positive\n\u2022Some, to large extent, many, much , exist in the assumption\n\u2022Some words like only, each, any, every, all, question indicating word (why, these, what), Answer\nindicating words (therefore), Definitely, But, Certainly exist in the assumption that assumption wil l\nalways be explicit (False).\n\u2022Some words like some, to large extent, many, much, exist in the assumption that assumption will\nalways be implicit (True).\n\u2022Any assumption that is conveying the message of advertisement, notice, appeal that assumption\nwill always be implicit (True).\n\u2022Any assumption that is talking about the social welfare (positive), govt. policies that assumption\nwill always be implicit (True).\n\u2022If any assumption is talking about past & future that assumption will always be explicit (False).\n\u2022If any assumption showing the word like suggestion, order, request that will always be implicit\n(True). Restatement is never implicit.\n\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 355\n\u2022Comparison always wrong.\nExample:\n#1Statement:\nEverybody loves reading adventure stories\nAssumption:\nAdventures stories are the only reading material.\nNobody loves Reading any other material.\n#2\nStatement:. \"If you want to study account join institute Y\",A advice to B.\nAssumption:\nInstitute Y provides good account education.\nB listen to A advice.\n#3\nStatement: The college administration has instructed all the students to stop using cell phone\nwithin the college premises.\nAssumption:\nThe student may stop using cell phone in the college premises\nThe student may continue to use cell phone in the college premises.\n#4\nStatement: Read the Notice before entering the club\nAssumption:\nPeople are literate.\nClub is not for blind person.\n#5\nStatement: ABC is the only magazine that provides good notes on Reasoning & Mathematics.\nAssumption:\nIt will have some effect on those who read.\nPeople always wait for latest Notes on reasoning & Mathematics.\n#6\nStatement: If you are a classical singer we have challenging job for you.\nAssumption:\nWe need a classical singer\nYou are a classical singer.\n#7\nStatement: Like a mad man I decided to follow him.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 356\nAssumption:\nI am a mad man.\nI am not a mad man.\n#8\nStatement: All the workers are here by instructed to reach the factory by 8:30 am.\nAssumption:\nSome of the worker will not arrived at the factory in time.\nWorker will follow the strict warning in the notice.\n#9\nStatement: You can't solve syllogism question without constructing a diagram (Venn). Difficult\nquestion of syllogism need Venn diagram solving, A teacher tells his students.\nAssumption:\nThe students are not intelligent.\nProblem cannot be solved.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 357\nDirections to Solve\nIn each question below is given a statement followed by two assumptions numbered I and II. You have to\nconsider the statement and the following assumptions and decide which of the assumptions is implicit  in\nthe statement.\nGive answer\n(A)If only assumption I is implicit\n(B)If only assumption II is implicit\n(C)If either I or II is implicit\n(D)If neither I nor II is implicit\n(E)If both I and II are implicit.\n1.Statement  : \"You are hereby appointed as a programmer with a probation period of one year and your\nperformance will be reviewed at the end of the period for confirmation.\" - A line in an appointment\nletter.\nAssumptions\nThe performance of an individual generally is not known at the time of appointment offer.\nGenerally an individual tries to prove his worth in the probation period.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option E\nExplanation\nThe performance of the individual has to be tested over a span of time as the statement mentions. So ,\nI is implicit. The statement mentions that the individual's worth shall be reviewed (during probatio n\nperiod) before confirmation. So, II is also implicit.\n2.Statement\nIt is desirable to put the child in school at the age of 5 or so.\nAssumptions\nAt that age the child reaches appropriate level of development and is ready to learn.Sample Questions\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 358\nThe schools do not admit children after six years of age.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer: Option A\nExplanation\nSince the statement talks of putting the child in school at the age of 5, it means that the child is\nmentally prepared for the same at this age. So, I is implicit. But nothing about admission after 6 y ears\nof age is mentioned in the statement. So, II is not implicit.\n3.Statement : \"In order to bring punctuality in our office, we must provide conveyance allowance to our\nemployees.\" - In charge of a company tells Personnel Manager.\nAssumptions\nConveyance allowance will not help in bringing punctuality.\nDiscipline and reward should always go hand in hand.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation\nAssumption I goes against the statement. So, it is not implicit. The allowance will serve as a rewar d to\nthe employees and shall provoke them to come on time. So, II is implicit.\n4.Statement  : Unemployment allowance should be given to all unemployed Indian youth above 18\nyears of age.\nAssumptions\nThere are unemployed youth in India who needs monetary support.\nThe government has sufficient funds to provide allowance to all unemployed youth.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 359\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option A\nExplanation\nI directly follow from the statement, so is implicit. Also, the statement is a suggestion and does n ot tell\nabout a government policy or its position of funds. So, II is not implicit.\n5.Statement : \"If you trouble me, I will slap you.\" - A mother warns her child.\nAssumptions\nWith the warning, the child may stop troubling her.\nAll children are basically naughty.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option A\nExplanation :\nThe mother warns her child with the expectation that he would stop troubling her. So, I is implicit.  The\ngeneral nature of children cannot be derived from the statement. So, II is not implicit.\n6.Statement  : The State government has decided to appoint four thousand primary school teachers\nduring the next financial year.\nAssumptions\nThere are enough schools in the state to accommodate four thousand additional primary school\nteachers.\nThe eligible candidates may not be interested to apply as the government may not finally appoint suc h\na large number of primary school teachers.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option A\nExplanation\nSuch decisions as given in the statement are taken only after taking the existing vacancies into\nconsideration. So, I implicit while II isn't.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 360\n7.Statement : A warning in a train compartment - \"To stop train, pull chain. Penalty for improper use Rs.\n500.\"\nAssumptions\nSome people misuse the alarm chain.\nOn certain occasions, people may want to stop a running train.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option E\nExplanation\nClearly, the penalty is imposed to prevent people from misusing the alarm chain. This means that som e\npeople misuse it. So, I is implicit. The alarm chain is provided to stop the running train in times of\nurgency. So, II is also implicit.\n8.Statement : If it is easy to become an engineer, I don't want to be an engineer.\nAssumptions\nAn individual aspires to be professional.\nOne desires to achieve a thing which is hard earned.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option B\nExplanation\nClearly, nothing is mentioned about the professional nature of the job. So, I is not implicit. The s tatement\nhints that one rejects a thing that is easy to achieve. So, II is implicit.\n9.Statement : The concession in rail fares for the journey to hill stations has been cancelled because it\nis not needed for people who can spend their holidays there.\nAssumptions\nRailways should give concession only to needy persons.\nRailways should not encourage people to spend their holidays at hill stations.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 361\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option A\nExplanation\nThe statement mentions that concessions should not be given to people who can afford to spend\nholidays in hill stations. This means they should be given only to needy persons. So, I is implicit.  But, II\ndoes not follow from the statement and is not implicit.\n10.Statement : \"The bridge was built at the cost of Rs. 128 crore and even civil bus service is not utilizing\nit, what a pity to see it grossly underutilized.\" - A citizen's view on a new flyover linking east a nd west\nsides of a suburb.\nAssumptions\nThe building of such bridges does not serve any public objective.\nThere has to be some accountability and utility of money spent on public projects.\nA.Only assumption I is implicit\nB.Only assumption II is implicit\nC.Either I or II is implicit\nD.Neither I nor II is implicit\nE.Both I and II are implicit\nAnswer : Option B\nExplanation\nClearly, the statement expresses grave concern over a newly-built flyover not being utilized by publ ic.\nThis implies that such projects need to be taken up only after working out their utility and that th e\nhuge expenditure incurred on building such structures is worthwhile only if they prove useful for th e\npublic. Thus, only II is implicit.\nFoot Notes\n1.Doyle Alison (2019), The Importance of Logical Thinking in the Workplace\u2019, The Balance Career.\navailable at: https://www.thebalancecareers.com/logical-thinking-definition-with-examples-\n2059690\n 2.See, https://philosophyterms.com/logical-reasoning/\n3.Source: https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_logic.html\n4.Source: https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_logic.html\n***\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 362\nLesson 7\n362VERBAL\nREASONING\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 363\nIntroduction\nReasoning means the action of thinking about something in a logical and sensible way. In our day to day\nwork, we apply the reasoning and try to work with logical sense. The general mental ability of a per son can\nbe well tested with the approach of Verbal and Non-verbal reasoning developed in the mind. In short the\nmental ability is depicted through this technique.\nWe begin with the word \u201cAnalogy\u201d. As per New Concise Oxford Dictionary, \u201cAnalogy\u201d means agreement,\nor similarity. Analogue is the process of reasoning from parallel cases. In simple way, we can say t hat,\nanalogy means correspondence or relationships.\nFollowing are to be noticed:\n1.Measurements and Instruments :\nWhen we say Temperature, we immediately think of Thermometer. When it comes to Blood\nPressure, we think of BP measuring machine.\n2.Quantity and unit:\nIf mass is to be measured, we say Kilograms.\nHowever, if time is to be measured, we say minutes or seconds or hours etc. depends on the\nnature of counting the time.\n3.Selection of Groups for individuals:\nWhen we say \u201cMan\u201d it gets associated with \u201cCrowd\u201d\nWhen we say \u201cSinger\u201d it can get associated with \u201cChorus\u201d\n4.Male and Female:\nWe can have a logical flow as Gentleman-Lady or Son-Daughter etc.\n5.Worker and working place:\nFor example we may say Doctor-Hospital or Clinic, and Manager-Bank, Teacher-School or college\netc.\n6.Product and Raw material:\nFor example, the Book-Paper, Jewelry-Gold, Shoes-Leather are some of the examples of the link of\nproduct and Raw Materials.\nIllustrative Examples:\nQ1. Mumbai: Maharashtra:: Ahmedabad:\na.Maharashtra   b. Gujrat    c. Uttar Pradesh   d. Canada\nHere the correct answer is \u2018b\u2019 Gujrat as Ahmedabad is capital city of Gujrat.\nQ2. Doctor: Nurse::Follower:\na.Worker    b. Employer     c. Leader     d. Union.\nHere, the correct answer is \u2018c\u2019 Leader as the nurse follows the instructions of the doctor, then, th e\nfollower also follows the instructions of the leader.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 364\nQuestions based on Directions\nIn the following types of questions, there are certain directions which one can understand; it is\nexpected to choose the correct alternatives:\nQ3. Moon: Satellite: :    Earth: ?\na.Solar system    b. Sun    c. Planet   d. Asteroid\nThe correct answer should be c. Planet in the above case.\nQ4. Clock: Time   : Thermometer: ?\na.Temperature    b. Energy    c. Heat    d. radiation.\nThe correct answer should be \u2018a\u2019 temperature as the Thermometer gives the direction of\ntemperature.\nQuestions Based on Relationship\nEach of the following questions consists of two words that have a certain relationships to each\nother, followed by four letter head pairs of words. Select that letterhead pair that has same\nrelationship as the original letterhead pair.\nQ5. Sound: Muffled::\na.Moisture: Humid   b. Colour: faded    c. Despair : Anger    d. Odour: Pungent\nThe correct answer is \u2018b\u2019 because the second is the process of the gradual disappearance of the\nfirst.\nQ6. Knowledge: Ignorance: :\na.Cure: Health    b. Conceal : Hide   c. Breath : Suffocation   d. Construction : war\nThe correct answer is \u2018c\u2019 as the words in each pair are antonyms of each other.\nLogical order:\nSometimes there can be logical order of the words or the given things. We understand more from\nthe following questions:\nQ7. Arrange the following words in the logical order: 1.Elbow 2.Wrist 3.Shoulder 4. Palm 5. Finger\na.2,4,5,3,1,    b. 5,4,2,1,3,   c. 3,4,5,2,1,   d. 3,1,4,2,5\nThe correct answer is \u2018b\u2019 as the logic of the arrangement matches in that order.\nQ8. The mobile manufacturing companies have increased the the prices of smartphones. The\ngovernment has recently increased the duty on the smartphones.\na.The statement II is the cause and statement I is the effect.\nb.Statement I is cause and statement II is the effect.\nc.Both statement I and II are independent causes\nd.Both statement I and II are effects of independent causes.\nThe correct answer is \u2018a\u2019 as the statement II is cause and statement I is an effect.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 365\nQ9. Choose the some relationship of the given words: Bald Eagle: America:: Wolf : ?\na.Australia    b. Spain   c. Italy   d. France\nAnswer is \u2018c\u2019 Italy as the Bald Eagle is national bird of America and Wolf is national animal of Ita ly.\nQ10. Appointment: Abiligy\na.Transfer : Punishment    b. Business : Money  c. Promotion : Merit  d. Examination: Success\nThe correct answer is \u2018c\u2019 as the first is the result of the second thing.\nQ11. Pulp: Paper\na.Rope : Hamp     b. Rayon : Cellulose    c. Thread : needle   d. Yarn : fabric\nHere the correct answer is \u2018d\u2019 as the first is used to make the second.\nQ12. Liquor : Drink\na.Bread: Butter   b. Tea : Bevarage   c.  Snuff: Inhale   d. Water : Sip\nThe correct answer is \u2018b\u2019 as the second denotes the class to which the first belongs.\nSeries Completion:\nIn this types of questions, the series of numbers are given and we have to choose that which is\nmost logically fitting to the same.\nQ13. Completing the given series: Which number would replace the question mark in the series 7,12,19,?,\n39\na.29     b.  28    c. 26    d. 24\nOne can easily understand that 7+5=12 and 12+7=19 so, the numbers are added by 5,7 and so\non. Therefore, 19+9=28. Hence the answer is 28.  So the answer is \u2018b\u2019\nThe Alphabet series: In this type of questions, we have to have logical flow of understanding the\nalphabets to get to the answer.\nQ14. What will be the next term in BDF, CFI, DHL,?\na.CJM      b. EIM       c. EJO    d. EMI\nClearly, the first, the second and the third letters of each term are respectively moved one, two\nand three steps forward to obtain the corresponding letters of the next term. So the missing term\nis EJO and hence the correct answer is \u2018c\u2019.\nThe Letter Series\nThis type of questions consists of the series of small letters which follow a certain pattern. Howev er, some\nletters are missing from the series. These missing letters are given a proper sequence as one of the\nalternatives. The candidate should choose proper alternative answer.\nFor example : aab__aaa___bba__ ?\na.baa    b. abb     c. bab   d.aab\nAnswer: We proceed step by step as below:\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 366\n1.The first blank space should be filled by \u2018b\u2019 so that we have two \u2018a\u2019 s followed by two \u2018b\u2019s\n2.The second blank space should be filled in either by \u2018a\u2019 so that we have four \u2018a\u2019s followed by\ntwo \u2018b\u2019s or by \u2018b\u2019s or by \u2018b\u2019 so that we have three \u2018a\u2019 s followed by three \u2018b\u2019s\n3.The last space must be filled in by \u2018a\u2019\n4.Thus we have two possible answers \u2018baa\u2019 and \u2018bba\u2019 but only \u2018baa\u2019 appears in the alternatives.\nSo the correct answer is \u2018a\u2019 above.\nNumber coding\nIn these type of questions, either the numerical codes are assigned to the word or alphabetical code s are\nassigned to the numbers. The candidate should analyses the code with direction:\nFor example : If in a certain language, A is coded as 1, B is coded as 2, and so on, how is BIDDIC coded in\nthat code?\na.294493    b.  284563     c. 375582    d. 394492\nAs the given letters are coded as A B C D E F G H I\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo, in BIDDIC, code B is coded as 2, I as 9, D as 4 and C as 3. Thus BIDDIC is coded as 294493\nhence the correct answer is \u2018a\u2019.\nRelations Puzzles\nIn this type, the mutual blood relations or other informations of more than two persons are mentione d\nand information about two is mentioned.\nExample  : A and B are brothers. C and D are sisters. A\u2019s son is D\u2019s brother. How is B related to C?\na.Father    b. brother c. Grandfather   d. Uncle   e. none of these.\nIn this example, clearly B is brother of A; A\u2019s son is D\u2019s brother. This means D is the daughter of A.\nSince C and D are sisters, C is also a daughter of A. So, B is the uncle of C. Hence the correct\nanswer is \u2018d\u2019.\nAlphabet Test\nThis is also called Alphabetical Order. Generally, there is not tough to understand and solve these types of\nquestions. With enough practice, everyone can ace these questions. Like there may be questions to fi nd\nthe English letters between two English alphabets given in the question. You will also be asked to f ind out\nthe place of English letter to the right or to the left of the one given in the question.\nQuestions may vary on the arrangement of alphabets. Like in some questions it may be backward, secon d\nhalf backward or multiple letter segments which are in changed order, etc. In some questions, one ma y be\nasked to find the letters that do not change with the change in their alphabetic arrangement and in some\nquestions you will be asked to find the middle letter of the two given English letters in the questi on.\nIt is important to note that while solving the questions of alphabetical order you need to keep in m ind the\nforward and backward position of all the alphabets along with its number.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 367\nQuestions Asked in Alphabetical Order\nThere is not one single type of question of alphabetical order that is asked in exams. But rather th ere are\nmany types of these questions which can be asked in the competitive exams. They are\n1.Series of alphabets\n2.Problems related to letter gap\n3.Problems related to word formation\n4.Words in the alphabetical order\nFor better understanding, we will provide you with the solved example of each and every type of ques tion\nthat can come under the Alphabetical Order section of Reasoning Ability.\nSeries of alphabets\nThis type of questions does not follow any rule and thus we would advise you to get enough practice.  So\nthat you can quickly solve these type of questions.\nQ.Which of the following options is fifth to the left of the 11th letter from the left in a forward se ries\nof the alphabet?\n1.H 2. G 3.I 4.E\nIn this type of question first we need to find the eleventh letter from the left in the forward seri es\nwhich is as follows:\nA B C D E F G H I J K. Here K is the eleventh letter in the series, now from the eleventh letter we\nneed to go five letters to the left again which will be: K J I H G. Hence G is the correct answer\nwhich is number 2 in the option.\nProblems related to the Letter Gap\nThis question is purely based on your logic and how quickly you remember the alphabets.\nQ.In the word \u2018CHAIRS\u2019, how many pairs of the letters have the same number of letters between\nthem in the word as in alphabet?\n1.1 2.3 3.4 4.2\nHere in between C and A, there is one letter H and in general alphabets also there is one letter\nbetween them which is B. While in R and S there are no letters in between which is the same as in\nthe alphabets. So the correct answer to this question is option - 4.\nProblems related to word formation\nThese questions require more practice than any other type of questions. It is also important to have  a\ngood set of vocabulary.\nQ.If the name of a game is formed by rearranging the letters of the word MODBANTIN, than what\nwill be the first and the last letter of the name?\n1.A, T  2.N, D 3.B, N  4.B, T\nHere the name of the game that will be formed is Badminton. And its first and last letters are B and\nN. Thus option (3) is the correct answer.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 368\nWords in the alphabetical order\nIn these types of questions, you need to find which word will come first based on their alphabetical  order\nQ.Arrange the question based on the initial letter of the word given in the alphabetical order.\n1.Fame 2.Shame 3.Name 4.Came\n\u2018Came\u2019 comes first in the alphabetical order. \u2018Fame\u2019 comes second in the alphabetical order.\n\u2018Name\u2019 comes third in the alphabetical order. \u2018Shame\u2019 comes forth in the alphabetical order.\nPractice Questions\n1.How many meaning words can be formed using the first, fourth, seventh, and eighth letter of the\nword \u2018SUPERFLUOUS\u2019?\nA.1 B.2 C.3 D.4\nAnswer : Option A\n2.How many letters are there in between the 7th letter from the left and 8th from right in the English\nAlphabets?\nA.8             B. 9 C.10 D.11\nAnswer : Option D\n3.Which is the 11th letter to the left of the 4th letter from the right when you write the English\nalphabets in backward order?\nA.P B.Q C.O D.N\nAnswer : Option C\nAlpha Numeric Sequence Puzzle\nIn Alpha numeric sequence puzzle, a mix up sentence consisting of some letters, numbers and symbols are\ngiven followed by some certain questions based on it.\nBased on following types, questions are categorized:\n\u2022Satisfying certain conditions in the given sequence, it is required to find elements (letters, numbe rs\nor symbols.\n\u2022At a certain given relative position in the sequence, it is need to determine the element.\n\u2022By converting the hidden part in relation to the position of the elements in the sequence, it is\nrequired to complete a series consisting of terms formed by a combination of the elements of the\nsequence.\n\u2022By finding the common property which other combinations share as per their positions in the\ngiven sequence, It is required to find the odd combination from among a given set of combinations\nof elements.\n\u2022To determine the analogical relationship between a given pair of combination of elements, later\nfind a combination which carry same relationship with another given combination.\nAlphanumeric sequence is a sequence which consists of both alphabets and numbers. In this sequence,\nwe can also add some symbols along with alphabets and numbers.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 369\nFor example we can make an alphanumeric sequence as follows -\nA $ E R 9 * T 5 F 6 @ D 8\nIn the above sequence, we can see that there are numbers, alphabets, and symbols. These types of\nsequences are called Alphanumeric Sequence. We can make many sequences like this and can deduce\nquestions based on the sequences.\nImportant Points to Remember\nLet\u2019s have an alphanumeric sequence -\nA $ E R 9 * T 5 F 6 @ D 8\nQuestions regarding this chapter can come in this way -\na.Which element is nth from the left of the sequence?\nb.Which element is nth from the right of the sequence?\nc.Which element is mth to the right of nth from the left of the sequence?\nd.Which element is mth to the left of nth from the left of the sequence?\ne.Which element is mth to the right of nth from the right of the sequence?\nf.Which element is mth to the left of nth from the right of the sequence?\ng.A precedes B\nh.B is preceded by A\ni.B follows A\nj.A is followed by B\nTo solve questions like this, we have to watch the sequence thoroughly and answer accordingly.\na.Which element is nth from the left of the sequence?\nTo get the answer of the above question, we have to look at the sequence from the left side and\nhave to count the exact number that is asked in the question.\nb.Which element is nth from the right of the sequence?\nTo get the answer of the above question, we have to look at the sequence from the right side and\nhave to count the exact number that is asked in the question.\nc.Which element is mth to the right of nth from the left of the sequence?\nTo get the answer for such type of questions, we have to find out the nth element from the left side\nof the sequence and then find out the mth element to the right of that particular element.\nd.Which element is mth to the left of nth from the left of the sequence?\nTo get the answer for such type of questions, we have to find out the nth element from the left side\nof the sequence and then find out the mth element to the left of that particular element.\ne.Which element is mth to the right of nth from the right of the sequence?\nTo get the answer for such type of questions, we have to find out the nth element from the right\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 370\nside of the sequence and then find out the mth element to the right of that particular element.\nf.Which element is mth to the left of nth from the right of the sequence?\nTo get the answer for such type of questions, we have to find out the nth element from the right\nside of the sequence and then find out the mth element to the left of that particular element.\ng.If it is written that A precedes B then it means A is placed before B.\nh.Similarly if it is written that B is preceded by A then it means A is placed before B.\ni.If it is written that B follows A then it means B is placed after A.\nj.If it is written that A is followed by B then B is placed after A.\nThese ten type of questions are normally asked in this chapter. Whether it is of a type or b type or  c type\nor j type we have to read the question carefully and see the sequence and finally we can get the\nanswer according to the question.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 371\nStudy the following arrangement carefully and answer the question given below -\n6 R 0 T 4 A 8 % B F 1 E # W @ 9 H I $ M N * 3 2 V $ 5 G P 7 Q\n1.How many such consonants are there in the above arrangement, each of which is immediately\npreceded by a consonant and immediately followed by a number?\nANone\nBOne\nCTwo\nDThree\nAnswer - C\nExplanation\nAccording to question \u2013\nConsonant \u2013 Consonant - Number\nB -F -1\nG -P -7\n2.How many such vowels are there in the above arrangement, each of which is immediately\npreceded by a letter but immediately not followed by a symbol?\nANone\nBOne\nCTwo\nDThree\nAnswer \u2013 B\nExplanation\nAccording to question\nLetter-Vowels-Letter/Number\nR - O - T\n3.Which of the following is the fourth to left of the twelfth from the left end?\nA8 BB C2 D %\nAnswer - DSample Questions\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 372\nExplanation\nAccording to question.\nL - L = L\n12 - 4 = 8TH\nSo the required element is %.\n4.Three of the following four are alike in a certain way based on their positive in the above\narrangement and so form a group.

Manufacturing\ntowels for the export market employing more than 2000 workers, the company had an impressive growth\nin sales and profits. The Chairman felt that employees were entitled to a share in the profits and i t was\nproposed that the employee mess be air-conditioned. The proposal was discussed in a meeting that was\nattended by, among other senior officials, the marketing director, the personnel director and the fi nance\ndirector. The proposal was based on the fact that the shop floor of the mill often had temperatures in\nexcess of 40\u00b0C with a relative humidity of 99%. The air-conditioned mess would represent management' s\nappreciation of the employee's hard work.\nAt the end of 2005, management reviewed the mill's performance. Profits were higher, and employee\nattrition was negligible. Chairman decided that employees deserved additional recognition for their fine\nwork. Since the mess had already been air-conditioned, the chairman wanted to know if the employees\nappreciated this sort of action. In the course of discussion, the chairman asked the personnel direc tor to\nsend a questionnaire to a sample of fifty employees and obtain their reaction to the air-conditioned  mess.\nThe management agreed to decide only after obtaining the feedback from the employees.\nThe personnel director mailed a simple form to fifty employees asked them for the following informat ion:\n\"Please state your reaction to the air-conditioned mess.\"\nOf the fifty forms mailed, forty-six were returned.

Base\nyour analysis on the information presented in the passage. Mark\nThe Society for Education in India (in short SEI) had been engaged in running primary schools in dif ferent\nparts of the country since 1950s. While attending a conference on employee selection, Mr. J Mehta, a\nsenior member of the society learned that a leading school had recently employed a psychologist to\nperform employment functions, i.e. recruitment and selection of teachers. Within two months of his\nreturn, Mr. J Mehta contacted a reputed university and employed a graduating psychologist, Mr. Bibek\nGupta. Mr. Bibek Gupta was employed by SEI with the single directive that he was to contribute to th e\nselection of teachers. This task had previously been the prerogative of principals of each school. M r. Gupta\nimmediately notified each principal that in the future he was to be notified of the personnel needs and in\nreturn he would recruit, screen and select the teachers.\nAt the end of his first year with SEI, Mr. Gupta realized that his efforts had resulted in failure. During his first\nfew months he encountered much opposition from several principals who had been managing schools\nfor ten or more years. They did not believe in newer psychological techniques and preferred selectin g\npeople based on their own assessment. Other principals frequently refused to accept the teachers sel ected\nby Mr. Gupta. Finally, Mr. Gupta began to notice fewer and fewer principals notifying him of vacanci es in\ntheir schools. Realizing that he was not making any effective contribution, Mr. Gupta submitted the\nsuggestion to the society members that support and co-operation of the school principals should be a\nmatter of executive order, or else his resignation should be considered.\n6.What was the flaw in the decision of selecting a psychologist for selecting teachers that led to the\nfinal situation?\nA:Mr. Mehta's decision was predominantly driven by the information about another school that\nhad enlisted the services of a psychologist for recruitment and selection.\nR:Both the administration of the school and managing teachers have been primary responsibilities\nof the principal of the school.\nA.If both A and R are based on information given in the passage and R is the correct explanation\nof A.\nB.If both A and R are based on information given in the passage but R is not the\ncorrect explanation of A.\nC.If A is based on information given in the passage but R is not based on the facts given.\nD.If A is not based on information given in the passage but R is based on the information given\nin the passage.\nE.If both A and R are not based on information given in the passage.\nAnswer : B\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 384\n7.What responsibilities were shouldered by Mr. Bibek in his first year of employment?\nA:Mr. Bibek had the responsibility of contributing his expertise to recruitment and selection of\nteachers.\nR:The board members wanted to systematize the recruitment and selection of the entire\norganization.\nA.if both A and R are based on information given in the passage and R is the correct explanation\nof A.\nB.if both A and R are based on information given in the passage but R is not the correct\nexplanation of A.\nC.if A is based on information given in the passage but R is not based on the facts\ngiven.\nD.if A is not based on information given in the passage but R is based on the information given\nin the passage.\nE.if both A and R are not based on information given in the passage.\nAnswer : C\nDIRECTIONS for questions 8 to 11 : A famous retail electronics showroom chain has six new mobile phone\nmodels - T, V , W , X, Y , and Z \u2013 each equipped with at least one of the following three options: digi tal camera,\nmusic player, and office document viewer.

We can modify the above table based on the additional information given in the question.\nAccordingly, Arjun and Bhim are the members who voted against the School Bill and Tax bill.\nBill For Against\nRecreation Bill Arjun, Bhim Karn\nSchool Bill Karn Arjun, Bhim\nTax Bill Karn Bhim, Arjun\nBy visual observation, it can be checked that Bhim votes against the school bill, thus option E is\ncorrect.\n2. We can modify the above table based on the additional information given in the question as\nfollows:\nBill For Against\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 386\nRecreation Bill Arjun, Bhim Karn\nSchool Bill Bhim Arjun, Karn\nTax Bill Karn Bhim, Arjun\nThus, it can be verified that Arjun and Karn each vote for exactly one bill. The other answer\nchoices do not follow from the above table. Hence, option A is correct.\n3. We can modify the above table based on the additional information given in the question as\nfollows:\nBill For Against\nRecreation Bill Arjun, Bhim Karn\nSchool Bill Karn Arjun, Bhim\nTax Bill Karn Bhim, Arjun\nThus, it can be observed that Karn votes for the school bill.\n4. We can modify the above table based on the additional information given in the question as\nfollows:\nBill For Against\nRecreation Bill Arjun, Bhim Karn\nSchool Bill Karn Arjun, Bhim\nTax Bill Karn Arjun, Bhim\nThus, Bhim votes for exactly one bill and hence option E is correct.\n5. The situation highlights the management\u2019s short-sightedness.\n6. Both A and R are mentioned in the passage, but R is not the correct reason for A.\n7. A is mentioned in the passage while R is not.\n8-11. Mobile Phone Digital Camera Music Player Office Document Viewer\nT\nV\n X\nW\nX\nY X X\nZ\nT may have any of three options.\nZ may have Music Player and either Digital Camera or Office Document Viewer.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 387\n8. It is clear from the table that it is possible to determine the option(s) of phones V , W, X and Y.\n9. Three or four mobile phones feature a music player.\n10. Z must have the music player and the office document viewer while T must have the digital\ncamera. So only 3 models have the music player and option 5 is false.\n11. After assigning different features to the mobiles, it is seen that exactly four of the six mobiles h ave\na document viewer. The best answer is option 3.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 388\nLogical Sequence Test\nIn this type of question, some words are given. You have to arrange these words in a meaningful orde r.\nThe order may be according to age, size and need etc.\nExample 1:\nArrange the following words in a meaningful order.\n1.Death 2.Marriage 3.Education 4.Birth 5.Funeral\nA.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 B.4, 2, 3, 1, 5 C.4, 3, 2, 5, 1 D.4, 3, 2, 1, 5\nAnswer is Option D\nExplanation : First of all a man is born then he takes education; after this he is married. Then after\nsometimes he dies. After death the order is of Funeral. So the correct order is 4, 3, 2, 1 and 5.\nExample 2:\nArrange the following words in a logical sequence.\n1.Grass 2.Curd 3.Milk 4.Cow 5.Butter\nA.1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nB.2, 3, 4, 5, 1\nC.4, 1, 3, 2, 5\nD.5, 4, 3, 2, 1\nAnswer is Option C\nExplanation : We know that cow eats grass and then gives milk. With the milk, curd is made and then\nfrom curd, butter is made. Hence logical sequence is Cow, Grass, Milk, Curd, Butter.\n1.Arrange the words given below in a meaningful sequence.\n1.Key 2.Door 3.Lock 4.Room 5.Switch on\nA.5, 1, 2, 4, 3 B.4, 2, 1, 5, 3 C.1, 3, 2, 4, 5 D.1, 2, 3, 5, 4\nAnswer : Option C\nExplanation : The correct order is : Key Lock Door Room Switch on\n2.Arrange the words given below in a meaningful sequence.\n1.Word 2.

The candidate is requir ed to find\nout how many times a number satisfying the conditions, specified in the question, occurs. This inclu des\nthe following category of sequences:\n\u2022Date-Time Sequence\n\u2022Number Sequence\n\u2022Ranking Sequence\nNumber T est\nIn this type of questions, generally a set, group or series of numerals is given and the candidate i s asked to\ntrace out numerals following certain given conditions or lying at specifically mentioned positions a fter\nshuffling according to a certain given pattern.\nExample\nHow many such 5s are there in the following number sequence each of which is immediately preceded\nby 3 or 4 but not immediately followed by 8 or 9?\n3 5 9 5 4 5 5 3 5 8 4 5 6 7 3 5 7 5 5 4 5 2 3 5 1 0\n(A)One (B)Three (C)Four (D)Five (E)None of these\nSolution\nAs you know, a number which comes after a given number is said to follow it while the one which\ncomes before the given number precedes it.\nThus, the number satisfying the given conditions may be marked as follows:\n3 5 9 5 4 5 3 5 8 4 6 7 3 7 5 5 4 2 3 1 0\nClearly, there are five such 5s. Hence, the answer is (d).\nRanking Test\nIn this type of questions, generally the ranks of a person both from the top and from the bottom are\nmentioned and the total number of persons is asked. However, sometimes this question is put in the f orm\nof a puzzle of interchanging seats by two persons.\nExample\nRohan ranks seventh from the top and twenty-sixth from the bottom in a class. How many students\nare there in the class?\n(A)31 (B)32 (C)33 (D)34Sample Questions\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 391\nSolution\nClearly, the whole class consists of:\n(i)6 student who have ranks higher than Rohan;\n(ii) Rohan; and\n(iii) 25 students who have ranks lower than Rohan, i.e, (6+1+25) = 32 students. Hence, the answer\nis (b).\nTime Sequence Test\nExample\nSatish remembers that his brother\u2019s birthday is after fifteenth but before eighteenth of February wh ereas\nhis sister Kajal remembers that her brother\u2019s birthday is after sixteenth but below nineteenth of Fe bruary.\nOn which day in February is Satish\u2019s brother\u2019s birthday?\n(A)16th (B)17th (C)18th (D)19th (E)None of these\nSolution\nAccording to Satish, the brother\u2019s birthday is on one of the days among 16th and 17th February. Acco rding\nto Kajal, the brother\u2019s birthday is on one of the days among 17th and 18th February. Clearly, Satish \u2019s\nbrother\u2019s birthday is on the day common to both the above groups, i.e., 17th February.\nSyllogism\nSyllogism is a form of deductive reasoning where you arrive at a specific conclusion by examining tw o\nother premises or ideas. Syllogism derives from the Greek word syllogismos, meaning conclusion or\ninference.\nSome syllogisms contain three components:\n\u2022Major Premise\n\u2022Minor Premise\n\u2022Conclusion\nFor Example  : All roses are flowers (major premise). This is a rose (minor premise). Therefore, I am holding\na flower (conclusion).\nTypes of Syllogism\nThe type of syllogism that typically contains these three components is categorical syllogism. Howev er,\nthere are two other major kinds of syllogism. We'll discuss each one here, plus enthymemes and syllo gistic\nfallacy.\nCategorical Syllogism\nAs we know, our first example about roses was a categorical syllogism. Categorical syllogisms follow  an \"If\nA is part of C, then B is part of C\" logic.\nLet's look at some more examples.\nAll cars have wheels. I drive a car. Therefore, my car has wheels.\n\u2022Major Premise : All cars have wheels.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 392\n\u2022Minor Premise : I drive a car.\n\u2022Conclusion : My car has wheels.\nAll insects frighten me. That is an insect. Therefore, I am frightened.\n\u2022Major Premise: All insects frighten me.\n\u2022Minor Premise: That is an insect.\n\u2022Conclusion: I am frightened.\nConditional Syllogism\nConditional syllogisms follow an \"If A is true, then B is true\" pattern of logic. They're often refe rred to as\nhypothetical syllogisms because the arguments aren't always valid. Sometimes they're merely an accep ted\ntruth.\nIf Katie is smart, then her parents must be smart.\n\u2022Major premise : Katie is smart.\n\u2022Conclusion : Katie's parents are smart.\nIf Richard likes Germany, then he must drive an Audi.\n\u2022Major premise : Richard likes Germany.\n\u2022Conclusion : He must like all things German, including their cars.\nDisjunctive Syllogism\nDisjunctive syllogisms follow a \"Since A is true, B must be false\" premise. They don't state if a ma jor or minor\npremise is correct. But it's understood that one of them is correct.\n\u2022Major Premise : This cake is either red velvet or chocolate.\n\u2022Minor Premise : It's not chocolate.\n\u2022Conclusion : This cake is red velvet.\n\u2022Major Premise : On the TV show Outlander, Claire's husband is either dead or alive.\n\u2022Minor Premise: He's not alive.\n\u2022Conclusion: Claire's husband is dead.\nEnthymemes\nAn enthymeme is not one of the major types of syllogism but is what's known as rhetorical syllogism.  These\nare often used in persuasive speeches and arguments.\nGenerally, the speaker will omit a major or minor premise, assuming it's already accepted by the aud ience.\nHe couldn't have stolen the jewelry. I know him.\n\u2022Major Premise: He couldn't have stolen the jewelry.\n\u2022Minor Premise: I know his character.\nHer new purse can't be ugly. It's a Louis Vuitton.\n\u2022Major Premise: Her new accessory can't be ugly.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 393\n\u2022Minor Premise: It's made by famous designer Louis Vuitton.\nIn an enthymeme, one premise remains implied. In the examples above, being familiar with someone or\nsomething implies an understanding of them.\nSyllogistic Fallacy\nSome syllogisms contain false presumptions. When you start assuming one of the major or minor premis es\nto be true, even though they're not based in fact - as with disjunctive syllogisms and enthymemes - you run\nthe risk of making a false presumption.\nAll crows are black. The bird in my cage is black. Therefore, this bird is a crow.\n\u2022Major Premise: All crows are black.\n\u2022Minor Premise: The bird in my cage is black.\n\u2022Conclusion: This bird is a crow.\nThe scenery in Ireland is beautiful. I'm in Ireland. Therefore, the scenery must be beautiful.\n\u2022Major Premise: The scenery in Ireland is beautiful.\n\u2022Minor Premise: I'm in Ireland.\n\u2022Conclusion: The scenery is beautiful.\nOf course, not every black bird is a crow and not all of Ireland is beautiful. When preparing a spee ch or\nwriting a paper, we must always make sure we're not making any sweeping generalizations that will ca use\npeople to make false presumptions.\nRules of Syllogism\nThere are six known rules of syllogism. However, they mainly apply to categorical syllogism, since t hat is\nthe only category that requires three components: major premise, minor premise, and conclusion. Here\nare six rules that will ensure you're making a strong and accurate argument.\n1.Rule One: There must be three terms: the major premise, the minor premise, and the conclusion\n- no more, no less.\n2.Rule Two: The minor premise must be distributed in at least one other premise.\n3.Rule Three: Any terms distributed in the conclusion must be distributed in the relevant premise.\n4.Rule Four: Do not use two negative premises.\n5.Rule Five: If one of the two premises are negative, the conclusion must be negative.\n6.Rule Six: From two universal premises, no conclusion may be drawn.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 394\nIn each of the following questions two statements are given and these statements are followed by two\nconclusions numbered (1) and (2). You have to take the given two statements to be true even if they seem\nto be at variance from commonly known facts. Read the conclusions and then decide which of the given\nconclusions logically follows from the two given statements, disregarding commonly known facts.\nGive answer:\n\u2022(A) If only (1) conclusion follows\n\u2022(B) If only (2) conclusion follows\n\u2022(C) If either (1) or (2) follows\n\u2022(D) If neither (1) nor (2) follows and\n\u2022(E) If both (1) and (2) follow.\n1.Statements : Some actors are singers.

These proofs are written entirely in words , so for the\nmoment we don't need to worry about the presentation details associated with mathematical symbols.\nThe general setup : You're on an island where each inhabitant is a truth-teller  or a liar. Truth-tellers\nalways tell the truth; liars always lie. Y ou're given some information about some people, usually in  the form\nof statements they make. You're asked to determine whether each person is a truth-teller or a liar. In some\ncases, it may be impossible to determine what everyone is, or the situation may be impossible.\nExample . You're on an island where each inhabitant is a truth-teller or a liar. Truth-tellers always tell t he\ntruth; liars always lie. Calvin and Phoebe are on the island.\nPhoebe says: \"If 34 is odd, then I am a truth-teller.\"\nCalvin says: \"Phoebe is a liar.\"\nDetermine whether each person is a truth-teller or a liar.\n1. See, Raymond Smullyan, What is the name of this book. New Y ork: Dover Publications, 2011.Pens\nPapers PencilsPencilsPens\nPapers\nBoth (1) and (2) follow.\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 398\n(In this problem, I notice that I can determine the truth or falsity of the statement \"34 is odd\" wi thout\nknowing anything about Phoebe or Calvin. So I'll start with it and see what follows from it.)\nSince \"34 is odd\" is false, the \"if\" part of Phoebe's statement is false. Hence, Phoebe's statement is true.\nTherefore, Phoebe must be a truth-teller.\nNow Calvin says \"Phoebe is a liar\", and that is false, since I just showed that Phoebe is a truth-te ller.\nTherefore, Calvin is a liar.\nThus, Phoebe is a truth-teller and Calvin is a liar.\nHere are some general ideas  about how you might approach a problem like this. Pick a character in the\nproblem --- let's say you pick \"Leopold\". Consider the two cases: \"Leopold is a truth-teller\" or \"Le opold is a\nliar\". You can picture the reasoning process as a tree:\nYou can start with either case --- let's suppose you start with \"Leopold is a truth-teller\". (Note t hat this\nmeans anything he said is true .) Reason from this until you get a contradiction , a solution (that is, you\nknow what all the characters are), or no conclusion .\nI'll consider the first of these three cases in more detail, but similar ideas hold for the other tw o cases.\nThus, suppose \"Leopold is a truth-teller\" gives a contradiction. Then he can't be a truth-teller, so  he must\nbe a liar. The \"Leopold is a truth-teller\" branch of the tree is finished: Switch to the \"Leopold is  a liar\" branch\nand start reasoning there.\n(a)If \"Leopold is a liar\" gives a contradiction, then both cases have given a contradiction and the\noriginal problem is impossible.\n(b)If \"Leopold is a liar\" gives a solution, then that's the answer to the original problem.Leopold\ntruth-tellerLeopold\nliar\nLeopold\ntruth-teller\ncontradictionLeopold\nliar\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 399\n(c)If \"Leopold is a liar\" gives no conclusion, then you need to take cases on another character. Let's\nsay Molly is another character. Then we have the cases \"Molly is a truth-teller\" and \"Molly is a lia r\",\nand they are sub-cases of \"Leopold is a liar\".\nNow you have to continue reasoning with the two branches \"Molly is a truth-teller\" and \"Molly is a l iar\".\nIf at some point all the branches end in contradictions, then the problem is impossible. If all the branches\nend in contradictions but one ends in a solution, then the solution is the answer to the problem. If  more\nthan one branch ends in a solution, the problem has multiple answers. If any of the branches ends in  no\nconclusion, and you have no more characters with which to take cases, then again the problem has\nmultiple answers.\nSimilar things would happen if our original choice (\"Leopold is a truth-teller\") gave a solution, or  no\nconclusion.\nIt may also be that you should have started reasoning with another character --- so in the example I  just\nwent through, maybe you should have started by taking cases on Molly instead of Leopold. As with a l ot\nof problem-solving and proof-writing, you should become accustomed to working on scratch paper and\npossibly throwing away early attempts in favor of later ones.\nExample. You're on an island where each inhabitant is a truth-teller  or a liar. Truth-tellers always tell the\ntruth; liars always lie. Calvin and Phoebe are on the island.Leopold\ntruth-teller\ncontradictionLeopold\nliar\ncontradiction\nImpossible !\nLeopold\ntruth-teller\ncontradictionLeopold\nliar\nsolution\nThat\u2019s it !\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 400\nCalvin says: \"One or both of us is a liar.\"\nDetermine whether each person is a truth-teller or a liar.\n\u2022Suppose Calvin is a liar. Then the statement \"One or both of us is a liar\" is true, contradicting th e\nfact that Calvin is a liar.\n\u2022Hence, Calvin is a truth-teller. Therefore, his statement is true, and at least one of them is a lia r.\nSince it isn't Calvin, it must be Phoebe.\n\u2022Thus, Calvin is a truth-teller and Phoebe is a liar.\nHere are other ideas for these kinds of problems.\n1.If there are statements whose truth value you know (like \"34 is odd\"), begin with that information\nand see what you can conclude. For example, if Phoebe says \"34 is odd\", then (since the statement\nis false) I know Phoebe is a liar.\n2.You must take cases in pairs, e.g. \"Calvin is a liar\" and \"Calvin is a truth teller\". And once you t ake\ncases, you must consider both.\n3.Don't take cases unless you have to --- that is, unless you can't go any further with the informatio n\nyou know.\n4.Observe that these solutions are written entirely in words: We aren't using truth tables here. You\nshould avoid using symbols unless they are necessary. Mathematics does not necessarily require\nthe use of symbols!\nIt's okay to use pictures to clarify your reasoning, but a picture is not a substitute for a verbal proof.\nExample.  You're on an island where each inhabitant is a truth-teller or a liar. Truth-tellers always tell the\ntruth; liars always lie. Calvin and Phoebe are on the island.\nCalvin says: \"If I am a liar, then Phoebe is a liar.\"\nPhoebe says: \"Calvin is a truth-teller.\"\nDetermine whether each person is a truth-teller or a liar.\nSuppose Calvin is a liar. Then his statement is false. Since it's an if-then statement, the if-part must be true\nand the then-part must be false. The if-part is \"I am a liar\", which is indeed true (by assumption).  Then then-\npart must be false, so \"Phoebe is a liar\" is false, and hence Phoebe is a truth-teller. This means P hoebe's\nstatement \"Calvin is a truth-teller\" is true, which contradicts our assumption that Calvin is a liar .\nSince \"Calvin is a liar\" led to a contradiction, Calvin must be a truth-teller. Now Phoebe says \"Cal vin is a\ntruth-teller\", so she is telling the truth, and she is a truth-teller. Calvin's statement is \"If I a m a liar, then\nPhoebe is a liar\". Both parts (\"I am a liar\" and \"Phoebe is a liar\") are false, so the if-then state ment is true,\nconsistent with Calvin being a truth-teller.\nSince \"Calvin is a liar\" led to a contradiction and \"Calvin is a truth-teller\" led to a solution (co nsistent with\nboth characters' statements), we find that Calvin is a truth-teller and Phoebe is a truth-teller.\nIt is noted that it's possible that a problem like this can't be solved, for either of the following  reasons:\n(a)There isn't enough information to determine what all the characters are.\n(b)The given situation is impossible: All the cases lead to contradictions.\n***\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 401\nLesson 8\n401NON-VERBAL\nREASONING\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 402\nAnalytical Reasoning\nAnalytical Reasoning is Qualitative and Quantitative reasoning in nature. People use analytical reas oning\nto scrutinise speech, documents, diagrams, charts and graphs, and gather the most relevant informati on.\nThose with strong analytical skills will consider how key elements within that information relate to  one\nanother, and are more likely to notice crucial patterns and details.\nAnalytical reasoning measure a candidate\u2019s critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\u2022Data may be presented in the form of written passages, graphs, tables or shapes.\n\u2022Where questions are based on a series of images, they have much in common with inductive\nreasoning and non-verbal reasoning tests.\n\u2022Written analytical reasoning questions assess many of the same skills as verbal reasoning tests.\nAnalytical reasoning evaluate Inductive and Deductive reasoning\nInductive reasoning  involves obtaining specific information relating to a topic/subject in order to make\npredictions based on such information.\nExample of Inductive Reasoning\n1.Every quiz has been eassy. Therefore the test will be easy.\n2.The teacher used power point in the last few classes. Therefore, the teacher will use power point\ntomorrow.\n3.Every fall there have been huricanes in the tropics this coming fall.\nDeductive reasoning  is the process of reaching a logical conclusion based on one or more given state-\nments, or premises.\nExample of deductive Reasoning\nAll Students eat pizza. Raman is a students at KKM. Therefore, Raman eats Pizza\nAll athletes work out in the gym. Karan is an athlete. Therefore, Karan works out in the gym.\nStudy the given information carefully and answer the questions that follow:\nAnalytical Reasoning Conditional Based\nA team of five is to be selected from amongst five boys A, B, C, D and E and four girls P, Q, R and S. Some\ncriteria for selection are:\n(a)A and S have to be together.\n(b)P cannot be put with R.\n(c)D and Q cannot go together.\n(d)C and E have to be together.\n(e)R cannot be put with B.\nUnless otherwise stated, these criteria are applicable to all the questions below\n1.If two of the members have to be boys, the team will consist of:\n(a) A, B, S, P , Q (b) A, D, S, Q, R (c) B, D, S, R, Q (d) C, E, S, P,\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 403\nSolution : Here we have, If A is selected, S has to be selected. If B is selected, R cannot be selected.\nIf D is selected, Q cannot be selected. Hence A, D, S, Q, R and B, D, S, R, Q are wrong. C, E, S, P,  Q\nis not possible because A and S should be together. So answer is option 1.\n2.If R be one of the members, the other members of the team are;\n(a) P, S, A, D (b) Q, S, A, D (c) P, S, C, E (d) S, A, C, E\nSolution : If R is selected, P cannot be selected. So, P, S, A, D is wrong.\nD and Q cannot be together. So, Q, S, A, D is wrong.\nS and A have to be together. So, P, S, C, E is wrong. The option (d) satisfies all the conditions.\nHence it is the answer.\n3.If two of the members are girls and D is one of the members, the members of the team other than\nD are:\n(a) P , Q, B, C (b) P, Q, C, E (c) P, S, A, B (d) P, S, C, E\nSolution : If D is selected, Q cannot be selected. So P, Q, B, C and P, Q, C, E are incorrect. S and A\nhave to be together. So, P , S, C, E is also wrong. The third option P, S, A, B satisfies all the con ditions,\nhence it is the answer.\nClassification\nClassification means to \u2018assort the items of a given group on the basis of a certain common quality they\npossess and spot the odd one out.\nIn these types of questions we will be provided with a group of 5 items out of which 4 would be simi lar to\none another in a certain relationship among themselves and 1 would differ from them\nExample 1 : Choose the odd one\n(a)Horse\n(b)lion\n(c)giraffe\n(d)cheetah\n(e)Panda\nSolution  : option(A) Except Horse all are wild animals\nExample 2 : Choose the odd one\n(a)1728\n(b)64\n(c)1331\n(d)343\n(e)441\nSolution  : option(e) except 441 all are perfect cube\nLegal Aptitude and Logical Reasoning 404\nExample 3 : Choose the odd one\n(a)Iron\n(b)mercury\n(c)Copper\n(d)zinc\n(e)aluminum\nSolution  : (b) mercury\nExplanation\nAmong all of the above only mercury is in liquid state at room temperature\n1.Four of the following five are alike in a certain way and so form a group.
